	abstract = {Widespread forest loss and fragmentation dramatically increases the proportion of forest areas located close to edges. Although detrimental, the precise extent and mechanisms by which edge proximity impacts remnant forests remain to be ascertained. By combining unmanned aerial vehicle laser scanning (UAV-LS) with field data from 46 plots distributed at varying distances from the edge to the forest interior in a fragmented forest of New-Caledonia, we investigated edge influence on forest structure, composition, function, above-ground biomass (AGB) and microclimate. Using simple linear regressions, structural equation modelling and variance partitioning, we analysed the direct and indirect relationships between distance to edge, UAV-LS-derived canopy structural metrics, understorey microclimate, AGB, taxonomic and functional composition while accounting for the potential influence of fine-scale variation in topography. We found that the distance to the closest forest edge was strongly correlated with canopy structure and that canopy structure was better correlated to forest composition, function, biomass and microclimate than distance to the closest forest edge. This suggests that the influence of edge is mediated by changes in canopy structure. Plots located near the edge exhibited a lower canopy with more gaps, higher microclimate extremes, lower biomass, lower taxonomic and functional diversity as well as denser wood and lower specific leaf area. UAV-LS-derived canopy structural metrics were relevant predictors of understorey microclimate, biomass and taxonomic and functional composition. Overall, the influence of topography was marginal compared to edge effects. Synthesis. Accounting for fine-scale variation in canopy structure captured by UAV-LS provides insights on the multiple edge impacts on key forest properties related to structure, diversity, function, biomass and microenvironmental conditions. Integrating UAV-LS-derived data can foster our understanding of cascading and interacting impacts of anthropogenic influence on tropical forest ecosystems and should help to improve conservation strategies and landscape management policies.},

	abstract = {Almost all world's forest areas are predicted to be near edges by 2100, making the detection and prediction of biodiversity responses to edges an urgent need. Yet, idiosyncratic observations across studies have hampered general inferences on the main drivers of edge effects. We provide a global meta-analysis on 674 forest edge-interior comparisons of plant and animal communities, considering both global and local drivers as well as their interactions, to predict the direction and magnitude of edge effects on species richness. We found a clear latitudinal gradient in both the direction and magnitude of edge effects, with edges in temperate regions having more species than interior forests, while tropical communities generally had fewer species at edges. Unexpectedly, communities near high-contrast edges had higher richness at edges more frequently than near low-contrast edges. In addition, richness decreases at edges were weaker in regions subjected to historical disturbance than regions without historical disturbance. These patterns were modulated by distance from the edge and became clearer when comparing more distant sampling locations. Our results provide possible explanations for the variable impacts of edge effects and thereby forest fragmentation on biodiversity, showing that a combination of local and global predictors are able to partially predict variation in edge effects.},

	abstract = {A long-distance edge effect influences structure of species-rich plant communities in temperate forest fragments surrounded by an agricultural landscape in Central Europe. Though the edge effect may be an aggregate of many environmental conditions, the thermal gradient from the forest edge to the forest interior deserves particular attention due to increasing ambient air temperature over the past decades. With regard to ongoing climate change, any reliable information about magnitude and distance of thermal gradients in these forest fragments has become of great importance. Therefore, we carried out seasonal measurements of forest air and soil temperature at a total 40 sites in 14 forest fragments in central Bohemia with areas ranging between 0.3 and 255 ha. In addition, we assessed spatial and vertical air temperature variability at two sites, on both south and north facing slopes. We found that differences in daily mean air temperature in these forest fragments is significantly modified by slope aspect (and/or slope inclination) and distance to the forest edge. A negative monotonic edge-related thermal gradient was apparent up to 100 m towards the forest interior with differences in daily mean air temperatures of about 0.3 °C. The magnitude of this edge thermal gradient is comparable to the effect of slope aspect. In addition to mean air temperature, maximum and minimum daily temperatures as well as mean soil temperature inside forest fragments also showed impacts caused by the edge effect and other environmental conditions (e.g. forest structure, elevation). The edge-related area closer than 100 m from the forest edge represents the majority (78\%) of forested land in the study area as well as a considerable part of temperate forests in Central Europe (40\%), including less fragmented mountain forests. Hence, the edge alteration of forest microclimate should be taken into serious consideration when planning adaptation measures against the consequences of climate change in Central Europe. The edge influence could be partially mitigated by preventing further forest fragmentation and the adoption of timber harvesting methods that avoid creation of clearings, such as single-tree selection. Even if such forest management measures are implemented in the study area, spatial patterns and gradients of environmental heterogeneity may be gradually reduced in the forest fragments as a result of further exposure to the combined effects of climate change and edge influence.},

	abstract = {Forest fragmentation is considered by many to be a primary cause of the current biodiversity crisis. The underlying mechanisms are poorly known, but a potentially important one is associated with altered thermal conditions within the remaining forest patches, especially at forest edges. Yet, large uncertainty remains about the effect of fragmentation on forest temperature, as it is unclear whether temperature decreases from forest edge to forest interior, and whether this local gradient scales up to an effect of fragmentation (landscape attribute) on temperature. We calculated the effect size (correlation coefficient) of distance from forest edge on air temperature, and tested for differences among forest types surrounded by different matrices using meta-analysis techniques. We found a negative edge-interior temperature gradient, but correlation coefficients were highly variable, and significant only for temperate and tropical forests surrounded by a highly contrasting open matrix. Nevertheless, it is unclear if these local-scale changes in temperature can be scaled up to an effect of fragmentation on temperature. Although it may be valid when considering “fragmentation” as forest loss only, the landscape-scale inference is not so clear when we consider the second aspect of fragmentation, where a given amount of forest is divided into a large number of small patches (fragmentation per se). Therefore, care is needed when assuming that fragmentation changes forest temperature, as thermal changes at forest edges depend on forest type and matrix composition, and it is still uncertain if this local gradient can be scaled up to the landscape.},

	abstract = {Global forest cover is heavily fragmented. Due to high edge-to-surface ratios in small forest patches, a large proportion of forests is affected by edge influences involving steep microclimatic gradients. Although forest edges are important ecotones and account for 20\% of the global forested area, it remains unclear how biotic and abiotic drivers affect forest edge microclimates at the continental scale. Here we report soil and air temperatures measured in 225 deciduous forest plots across Europe for two years. Forest stands were situated along a latitudinal gradient and subject to a varying vegetation structure as quantified by terrestrial laser scanning. In summer, the average offset of air and soil temperatures in forest edges compared to temperatures outside the forest amounted to -2.8 °C and -2.3 °C, respectively. Edge-to-interior summer temperature gradients were affected by the macroclimate and edge structure. From the edge onwards, larger offsets were observed in dense forest edges and in warmer, southern regions. In open forests and northern Europe, altered microclimatic conditions extended deeper into the forest and gradients were steeper. Canopy closure and plant area index were important drivers of summer offsets in edges, whereas in winter also the forest-floor biomass played a key role. Using high-resolution maps, we estimated that approximately 10\% of the European broadleaved forests would be affected by altered temperature regimes. Gradual transition zones between forest and adjacent lands are valuable habitat types for edge species. However, if cool and moist forest interiors are desired, then (i) dense and complex forest edges, (ii) an undisturbed forested buffer zone of at least 12.5 m deep and (iii) trees with a high shade casting ability could all contribute to an increased offset. These findings provide important guidelines to mitigate edge influences, to protect typical forest microclimates and to adapt forest management to climate change.},

	abstract = {As urbanization and forest fragmentation increase around the globe, it is critical to understand how rates of respiration and carbon losses from soil carbon pools are affected by these processes. This study characterizes soils in fragmented forests along an urban to rural gradient, evaluating the sensitivity of soil respiration to changes in soil temperature and moisture near the forest edge. While previous studies found elevated rates of soil respiration at temperate forest edges in rural areas compared to the forest interior, we find that soil respiration is suppressed at the forest edge in urban areas. At urban sites, respiration rates are 25\% lower at the forest edge relative to the interior, likely due to high temperature and aridity conditions near urban edges. While rural soils continue to respire with increasing temperatures, urban soil respiration rates asymptote as temperatures climb and soils dry. Soil temperature- and moisture-sensitivity modeling shows that respiration rates in urban soils are less sensitive to rising temperatures than those in rural soils. Scaling these results to Massachusetts (MA), which encompasses 0.25 Mha of the urban forest, we find that failure to account for decreases in soil respiration rates near urban forest edges leads to an overestimate of growing-season soil carbon fluxes of {\textgreater}350,000 Mg C. This difference is almost 2.5 times that for rural soils in the analogous comparison (underestimate of {\textless}143,000 Mg C), even though rural forest area is more than four times greater than urban forest area in MA. While a changing climate may stimulate carbon losses from rural forest edge soils, urban forests may experience enhanced soil carbon sequestration near the forest edge. These findings highlight the need to capture the effects of forest fragmentation and land use context when making projections about soil behavior and carbon cycling in a warming and increasingly urbanized world.},

Here, we use ground surveys of terrestrial LiDAR in Central Amazonia to explore the influence of forest edge effects on tree architecture and allometry, as well as forest biomass, 40 years after fragmentation. We find that young trees colonising the forest fragments have thicker branches and architectural traits that optimise for light capture, which result in 50\% more woody volume than their counterparts of similar stem size and height in the forest interior. However, we observe a disproportionately lower height in some large trees, leading to a 30\% decline in their woody volume. Despite the substantial wood production of colonising trees, the lower height of some large trees has resulted in a net loss of 6.0 Mg ha−1 of aboveground biomass – representing 2.3\% of the aboveground biomass of edge forests. Our findings indicate a strong influence of edge effects on tree architecture and allometry, and uncover an overlooked factor that likely exacerbates carbon losses in fragmented forests.},

We analyze {\textgreater}48,000 forest inventory plots across the north-eastern US using a quasi-experimental matching design. At forest edges adjacent to anthropogenic land covers, we report increases of 36.3\% and 24.1\% in forest growth and biomass, respectively. Inclusion of edge impacts increases estimates of forest productivity by up to 23\% in agriculture-dominated areas, 15\% in the metropolitan coast, and +2\% in the least-fragmented regions. We also quantify forest fragmentation globally, at 30-m resolution, showing that temperate forests contain 52\% more edge forest area than tropical forests.

So far, we do not know how light availability and sub-canopy temperature interactively mediate the impact of macroclimate warming on understorey communities. We therefore assessed the functional response of understorey plant communities to warming and light addition in a full factorial experiment installed in temperate deciduous forests across Europe along natural microclimate, light and macroclimate gradients. Furthermore, we related these functional responses to the species’ life-history syndromes and thermal niches. We found no significant community responses to the warming treatment. The light treatment, however, had a stronger impact on communities, mainly due to responses by fast-colonizing generalists and not by slow-colonizing forest specialists. The forest structure strongly mediated the response to light addition and also had a clear impact on functional traits and total plant cover. The effects of short-term experimental warming were small and suggest a time-lag in the response of understorey species to climate change. Canopy disturbance, for instance due to drought, pests or logging, has a strong and immediate impact and particularly favours generalists in the understorey in structurally complex forests.},

	abstract = {Forest microclimates contrast strongly with the climate outside forests. To fully understand and better predict how forests' biodiversity and functions relate to climate and climate change, microclimates need to be integrated into ecological research. Despite the potentially broad impact of microclimates on the response of forest ecosystems to global change, our understanding of how microclimates within and below tree canopies modulate biotic responses to global change at the species, community and ecosystem level is still limited. Here, we review how spatial and temporal variation in forest microclimates result from an interplay of forest features, local water balance, topography and landscape composition. We first stress and exemplify the importance of considering forest microclimates to understand variation in biodiversity and ecosystem functions across forest landscapes. Next, we explain how macroclimate warming (of the free atmosphere) can affect microclimates, and vice versa, via interactions with land-use changes across different biomes. Finally, we perform a priority ranking of future research avenues at the interface of microclimate ecology and global change biology, with a specific focus on three key themes: (1) disentangling the abiotic and biotic drivers and feedbacks of forest microclimates; (2) global and regional mapping and predictions of forest microclimates; and (3) the impacts of microclimate on forest biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in the face of climate change. The availability of microclimatic data will significantly increase in the coming decades, characterizing climate variability at unprecedented spatial and temporal scales relevant to biological processes in forests. This will revolutionize our understanding of the dynamics, drivers and implications of forest microclimates on biodiversity and ecological functions, and the impacts of global changes. In order to support the sustainable use of forests and to secure their biodiversity and ecosystem services for future generations, microclimates cannot be ignored.},

	abstract = {The urban heat island (UHI) causes strong warming of cities and their urban forests worldwide. Especially urban forest edges are strongly exposed to the UHI effect, which could impact urban forest biodiversity and functioning. However, it is not known to what extent the UHI effect alters edge-to-interior microclimatic gradients within urban forests and whether this depends on the forests’ structure. Here we quantified gradients of air temperature, relative air humidity and vapour pressure deficits (VPD) along urban forest edge-to-interior transects with contrasting stand structures in six major cities across Europe. We performed continuous hourly microclimate measurements for two consecutive years and analysed the magnitude and depth of edge effects, as well as forest structural drivers of microclimatic variation. Compared to edge studies in rural temperate forests, we found that edge effects reached deeper into urban forests, at least up to 50 m. Throughout the year, urban forest edges were warmer and drier compared to forest interiors, with the largest differences occurring during summer and daytime. Not only maximum, but also mean and minimum temperatures were higher at the urban forest edge up to large edge distances (at least 85 m). Denser forests with a higher plant area index buffered high air temperatures and VPDs from spring to autumn. We conclude that urban forest edges are unique ecotones with specific microclimates shaped by the UHI effect. Both forest edges and interiors showed increased buffering capacities with higher forest canopy density. We advocate for the conservation and expansion of urban forests which can buffer increasingly frequent and intense climate extremes. To this end, urban forest managers are encouraged to aim for multi-layered dense forest canopies and consider edge buffer zones of at least 50 m wide.},

	abstract = {There are multiple pressures on Amazon forests due to, anthropic activities such as extensive cattle ranching, logging, and legal and illegal crops. These pressures generate highly fragmented landscapes that leads to an increase in forest edges. Thus, forest vegetation exposed to the surrounding open environment generates a series of direct effects that extend into the interior of the forest. Changes in the microclimate are among the most notable effects, and these can impact the composition and structure of the vegetation and affect the alteration of multiple ecological processes and ecosystem services. To better understand these consequences, we evaluated the distance of the edge influence on the microclimate, the composition of the vegetation, and the forest structure in the northern Amazon. We considered two types of edges according to adjacent cover: grasslands dedicated to extensive cattle ranching and rubber plantations (Hevea brasiliensis (Willd. ex A.Juss.) Müll.Arg.). We recorded significant differences in the composition and abundance of plants of all size categories. We found less richness and dominance of generalist species, that are characteristic of disturbed environments, in the forest sector adjacent to pastures. These edges had also lower humidity and higher temperatures than rubber plantations ones. The distance from the edge to the interior also affected the structure of the vegetation, with a higher density of individuals in the interior of the forest and significant differences in the diameter and height of individuals. We argue that the rubber plantations could be used as a forest management strategy of drought adaptation since it forms a less abrupt border and has a buffer function, keeping higher humidity values and lower temperatures than forest edges adjacent to pastures.},

	abstract = {Abstract Species–environment relationships are often studied at large spatial scales, but effective conservation requires an understanding of local-scale environmental drivers and pressures. Widespread degradation and fragmentation of forests have increased the proportion of tropical mammal habitat that is affected by edge effects. Edge effects include greater exposure to anthropogenic disturbance and abiotic changes that synergistically influence how well populations can cope with climate change. We investigated relationships between distance to the forest edge, forest structure, microclimate and terrestrial mammal detections in a selectively logged forest at the boundary of Gunung Leuser National Park in Sumatra, Indonesia. We collected mammal detection data from motion-activated camera traps, microclimate data from automated climate data loggers and forest structure data from vegetation plots. Daily mean and maximum temperatures significantly decreased with distance from the forest edge, whereas tree height and minimum temperature increased. Mammal diversity was lower at the forest edge compared to the interior. Mammals were detected less frequently at the forest edge, although this relationship varied between mammal orders. Mammal detections were best explained by temperature, tree height and tree diameter at breast height. These results demonstrate that abiotic changes in forests brought on by edge effects have negative impacts on mammals, but these effects vary between mammal taxa because of differing sensitivities to human disturbance. Our findings highlight the importance of considering local-scale environmental drivers in determining species–environment relationships to identify key habitat features such as microclimate refuges that should be prioritized in ecosystem management.},

	abstract = {Forest fragmentation increases the amount of edges in the landscape. Differences in wind, radiation, and vegetation structure create edge-to-interior gradients in forest microclimate, and these gradients are likely to be more pronounced during droughts and heatwaves. Although the effects of climate extremes on edge influences have potentially strong and long-lasting impacts on forest understory biodiversity, they are not well understood and are not often considered in management and landscape planning. Here we used a novel method of retrospectively quantifying growth to assess biologically relevant edge influences likely caused by microclimate using Hylocomium splendens, a moss with annual segments. We examined how spatio-temporal variation in drought across 3 years and 46 sites in central Sweden, affected the depth and magnitude of edge influences. We also investigated whether edge effects during drought were influenced by differences in forest structure. Edge effects were almost twice as strong in the drought year compared to the non-drought years, but we did not find clear evidence that they penetrated deeper into the forest in the drought year. Edge influences were also greater in areas that had fewer days with rain during the drought year. Higher levels of forest canopy cover and tree height buffered the magnitude of edge influence in times of drought. Our results demonstrate that edge effects are amplified by drought, suggesting that fragmentation effects are aggravated when droughts become more frequent and severe. Our results suggest that dense edges and buffer zones with high canopy cover can be important ways to mitigate negative drought impacts in forest edges.},

	abstract = {As landscapes become increasingly fragmented, research into impacts from disturbance and how edges affect vegetation and community structure has become more important. Descriptive studies on how microclimate changes across sharp transition zones have long existed in the literature and recently more attention has been focused on understanding the dynamic patterns of microclimate associated with forest edges. Increasing concern about forest fragmentation has led to new technologies for modeling forest microclimates. However, forest boundaries pose important challenges to not only microclimate modeling but also sampling regimes in order to capture the diurnal and seasonal dynamic aspects of microclimate along forest edges. We measured microclimatic variables across a sharp boundary from a clearing into primary lowland tropical rainforest at La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica. Dynamic changes in diurnal microclimate were measured along three replicated transects, approximately 30 m in length with data collected every 1 m continuously at 30 min intervals for 24 h with a mobile sensor platform supported by a cable infrastructure. We found that a first-order polynomial fit using piece-wise regression provided the most consistent estimation of the forest edge, relative to the visual edge, although we found no “best” sensing parameter as all measurements varied. Edge location estimates based on daytime net shortwave radiation had less difference from the visual edge than other shortwave measurements, but estimates made throughout the day with downward-facing or net infrared radiation sensors were more consistent and closer to the visual edge than any other measurement. This research contributes to the relatively small number of studies that have directly measured diurnal temporal and spatial patterns of microclimate variation across forest edges and demonstrates the use of a flexible mobile platform that enables repeated, high-resolution measurements of gradients of microclimate.},

	abstract = {Microclimates play a prominent role in efforts to conserve species in the face of climate change. However, climate-change research often relies on macroclimate data to predict species’ responses to climate change and may not accurately represent the temperatures actually experienced by organisms. Our objective was to characterize microclimates near the southern boundary of the boreal biome, a region seeing rapid declines and poleward range shifts of many boreal animal and plant species. We deployed sixty temperature loggers within three boreal sites in northern Wisconsin, USA, over a span of nine months. We used generalized additive models to assess how environmental factors influenced the recorded microclimates and how the recorded microclimates compared to weather station and macroclimate data. We also compared these empirical microclimates with predicted microclimates within the geographic range of black spruce (Picea mariana), the dominant tree species at the sampled sites. Averaged over nine months of sampling, we recorded consistent variation—up to 2.6 °C and 3.3 °C for minimum and maximum temperature—among sensors within several hundred meters of each other. Canopy cover was associated with the largest share (∼2.7 °C) of this variation. Minimum temperatures averaged 0.32 °C cooler than predicted by a common macroclimate product, whereas maximum temperatures were 1.15 °C degrees warmer than predicted. Finally, the empirical trailing-edge microclimates tended to be warmer than biome-wide microclimates, especially for maximum temperature in the spring and summer months. An important implication of our work is that the best locations to avoid thermal stress may shift over diel or seasonal cycles, creating a challenge for sessile organisms or for mobile ones with spatially anchored life-history events (e.g., nesting). In addition, our results (microclimate temperatures {\textgreater} 1 °C warmer than macroclimate data) suggest that ecological studies may underestimate the effects of climate change on trailing-edge boreal organisms. Identifying and managing microclimates that can slow the toll of climate change on organisms is a complex undertaking, and future work should evaluate whether animals exhibit the behavioral flexibility to capitalize on these microclimates and whether such decisions enhance fitness or survival.},

	abstract = {Background: Amplified edge effects stemming from land use change interfere with the community dynamics of forests by altering abiotic conditions. However, the impact of oil palm plantation-induced edge effects on forest remnants is still not well-understood. This study investigated the edge influences of an oil palm plantation on adjoining rainforest remnants’ microclimates and regeneration, along with variations in the effects imposed by oil palm stands’ structural differences. Parallel transects were established perpendicular to the forest border in four forest patches. Distance and magnitude of edge influence (DEI and MEI, respectively) were calculated for each response variable, and PCA and ANOVA tests were used to examine variations among the variables.
Results: DEIs did not extend beyond 60 m, while the number of influenced variables decreased with increasing oil palm stand shade. MEI values were generally low, except for light intensity and seedlings. Significant differences were mostly observed only for variables at the forest fringe, and the reduction in edge influence was most prominent only with a minimum stand height of 8.5 m. Invasive undergrowth species penetrated less into the forest interior with more shade. Tree regeneration, especially of old growth species, was low, and seedlings were dominated by fast-growing trees.
Conclusion: Forest remnants benefit from edge effect-minimizing shade, but by the time this shade has formed, regeneration has already been impacted. Sustaining the ecosystem integrity of forest fragments consequently requires continuous shade from adjacent ecosystems coupled with intervention to boost old growth forest species’regeneration in low-shade areas.},

We evaluated the effects of microclimatic conditions, and the direct and indirect effects caused by changes in plant resources and leafminer abundance on leafminer herbivory and parasitism in the interior, and north and south-facing edges of Chaco Serrano forest fragments in central Argentina. 3. In the interior, and north and south-facing edges of six forest fragments, we recorded: microclimatic variables, plant resource characteristics, leaf-mining larvae availability, and leafminer herbivory and parasitism at plant community level and in three species (Croton lachnostachyus, Cestrum parqui, and Solanum argentinum). 4. Herbivory was higher in north-facing edges compared to south-facing edges, while parasitism was generally greater in edges than in the interior. Temperature fluctuations positively affected plant community herbivory (through changes in leafminer abundance) but negatively affected S. argentinum herbivory via changes in foliar area and leaf-mining larvae availability. Lower humidity levels directly favoured parasitism at plant community level, whereas higher thermal variations enhanced the parasitism of S. argentinum leafminers. Greater solar radiation favoured parasitism of C. lachnostachyus leafminers. 5. Our results highlighted idiosyncrasy of each studied system (plant community and focal plant species), which responded differently to microclimate, and showed that mechanisms triggering herbivory and parasitism were different. The interior, and north and south-facing edges of these forest fragments may function as differential micro-refuges for herbivores and parasitoids under global warming context.},

	abstract = {Forest ecosystems buffer climate extremes and mitigate climate change effects 
below the canopy by creating a different microclimate which might serve as local 
refugia for many species under climate warming scenarios. Forest buffering 
capacity varies greatly depending on forest structure or macroclimatic temperature, 
and is severely threatened by increasing forest fragmentation and land use change 
that create more forest edges, whose buffering capacity is lower compare to forest 
interiors. Worldwide, a significant extent of the total forest area is located next to a 
forest edge and therefore subjected to strong edge effects. Edge effects are regarded 
as one of the main drivers of habitat fragmentation impacts on biodiversity. 
However, our understanding of how the forest respond to this alteration is based 
almost exclusively on herb layer community studies, although this is not sufficient 
to understand forest understorey community responses. Particularly, edge effects 
on the soil seed bank of temperate forests in the context of climate change are 
scarcely studied. This is a shortcoming as the soil seed bank is a key component of 
the biodiversity of plant communities and plays a crucial role in forest 
conservation, population dynamics and forest functioning. 
The main goal of this research was to assess forest edge effects on soil seed bank 
composition and diversity along macroclimatic and microclimatic gradients and in 
relation to climate change. To reach this objective we studied the soil seed bank of 
ancient European temperate deciduous forests with two field experimental studies 
(realised soil seed bank) and a greenhouse experiment (potential soil seed bank).
Besides quantifying the amount and diversity of seeds stored belowground, we also 
focused on the germination responses and seedling establishment as the 
environmental conditions required in these early stages as well as the impacts of 
environmental changes on them can differ greatly from that of the adults. A deeper 
knowledge of seed germination and seedlings' development and adaptations to 
1
forest microclimate is pivotal as the establishment is a critical phase in the plant life 
cycle. In the field studies, we focused on two distinct climatic regions and forest 
types (thermophilous forests of Italy and mesophilous forests of Belgium). We 
sampled the soil seed bank and then, through the installation of experimental plots 
in the forest, we translocated the soil from the forest edge to the interior (and vice 
versa) and from high to low elevation forests (to simulate climate warming). In the 
greenhouse experiment, we covered a 2300 km latitudinal gradient crossing nine 
European regions. We compared the persistent soil seed bank collecting soil 
samples in 90 plots from northern to southern Europe, from low elevation to high 
elevation forest, from dense to open forests and from the forest edge to the forest 
interior. 
Edge effects altered the soil seed bank diversity and composition by increasing the 
proportion of open habitat and generalist species. However, no significant influence 
on the proportion of typical forest species was observed. These findings highlight, 
on the one side, the importance of protecting large forest areas to reduce the inflow 
of external seeds in the soil seed bank and avoid potential compositional shifts and, 
on the other side, the ecological value of forest edge microhabitat, which is not 
unsuitable for the persistence of forest herbs seeds and seedlings. The present 
amount of typical forest herbs stored as persistent seeds in forests suggests that the 
contribution of soil seed banks towards the survival of forest species in 
communities undergoing environmental changes could be substantial. At least in 
the short term, seed banks are expected to buffer environmental variations induced 
by the edge effect through the maintenance of belowground species richness and 
thus through effects on the aboveground community composition. Additionally, 
simulated climate warming changed both the taxonomic and the functional 
composition of the realised soil seed bank, with negative consequences on the 
germination of forest herbs and the increase of warm-adapted species in the 
realised communities. Climate warming is thus expected to induce compositional 
2
and functional shifts in temperate forest understorey communities through 
constraints in the germination of soil seed bank species. These changes might result 
in altered forest biodiversity and functioning. With future rising temperatures, 
dense forest cover and management practices that do not cause the opening of the 
canopy on a large scale should be adopted. In this way, temperature extremes 
would be better buffered and the conservation of shade-tolerant forest species of 
the understorey more likely be assured. Indeed, we found that forest structure 
affected the germination responses from the seed bank. Specifically, denser 
canopies promoted forest species regeneration whereas open canopies promoted 
those of light demanding and generalist species. 
This PhD research gives a novel perspective on the impact of forest fragmentation, 
edge effects and climate change on temperate forest ecosystems and provides 
guidelines on how to preserve biodiversity through the soil seed bank. We suggest 
that the expected combined negative effects of climate change and edge effects 
might be partially mitigated in the future by preventing further forest 
fragmentation, by management of the existing forest edges and by the use of forest 
management methods that prevent the creation of large clearings. Finally, we 
provide a complete list of species and relative abundance of the realised and 
potential soil seed banks along forest edges and interiors of temperate European 
forests, from Norway to Italy. We believe that this can be an important tool for 
forest managers oriented to conservation goals. Further, we expect that this 
knowledge may be a valuable starting point for future studies and a basis for 
resurveys to monitor the effects of changing climatic conditions on forest 
ecosystems.},

Although microclimatic conditions in anthropogenically fragmented ecosystems have received considerable scientific attention, they are understudied in naturally fragmented ecosystems, including forest-steppes. In addition, earlier investigations in these mosaics only measured microclimate parameters for a very short period (i.e., 24 hours on a single summer day). In the present study, the long-term microclimatic conditions were described in multiple habitat types, both woody and non-woody, in a sandy forest-steppe ecosystem in the Kiskunság, central Hungary. The aim of this study was to answer (1) how air humidity and temperature conditions differ among the studied habitats during the growing season and (2) which habitats are more stressed to vegetation growth regarding vapor pressure deficit (VPD). Wireless sensors recording air temperature and humidity values were used to monitor microclimatic parameters. VPD values were calculated based on the obtained air temperature and humidity, and two thresholds at 1.2 and 3.0 kPa were defined. To compare mean air temperature and humidity variables, as well as above-threshold VPD rate among habitat types, general linear models were used. Our results indicated that open grasslands were the warmest and driest habitats. Among woody habitats, south-facing edges had the harshest microclimatic conditions. The current work also found that small forest patches and larger forest patches had similar air temperature and humidity variables. Regarding VPD, open grasslands were the most stressed for vegetation growth from May to October. During the summer season, forest patches had a small moderating effect at the limiting threshold of 1.2 kPa VPD, but a stronger moderating effect at the 3.0 kPa threshold. With ongoing climate change, this role of forest patches is expected to become increasingly important in forest-steppes. Therefore, it is suggested that the remaining near-natural forest stands in sandy forest-grassland ecosystems should be prioritized for protection, and that scattered trees or groups of trees of native species should be established in extensive treeless grasslands.},

Microclimate science is increasingly used to understand and mitigate climate and biodiversity shifts. Here, we provide an overview of the current status of microclimate ecology and biogeography in terrestrial ecosystems, and where this field is heading next. Microclimate investigations in ecology and biogeography We highlight the latest research on interactions between microclimates and organisms, including how microclimates influence individuals, and through them populations, communities and entire ecosystems and their processes. We also briefly discuss recent research on how organisms shape microclimates from the tropics to the poles. Microclimate applications in ecosystem management Microclimates are also important in ecosystem management under climate change. We showcase new research in microclimate management with examples from biodiversity conservation, forestry and urban ecology. We discuss the importance of microrefugia in conservation and how to promote microclimate heterogeneity. Methods for microclimate science We showcase the recent advances in data acquisition, such as novel field sensors and remote sensing methods. We discuss microclimate modelling, mapping and data processing, including accessibility of modelling tools, advantages of mechanistic and statistical modelling and solutions for computational challenges that have pushed the state-of-the-art of the field. What's next? We identify major knowledge gaps that need to be filled for further advancing microclimate investigations, applications and methods. These gaps include spatiotemporal scaling of microclimate data, mismatches between macroclimate and microclimate in predicting responses of organisms to climate change, and the need for more evidence on the outcomes of microclimate management.},

	abstract = {Mapping the microclimate effect of forest canopies on understory temperature requires spatially explicit predictors at very fine spatial resolutions. Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) offers promising prospects in that regard, as it allows capturing the vertical dimension of vegetation structure at a very high resolution over large areas. To explore the potential of airborne LiDAR-derived metrics to predict understory temperature, we focused on the forest of Blois (France), a 2740-ha lowland managed forest dominated by oak (Quercus petraea). We installed HOBO sensors measuring microclimate air temperature at one-metre height in 53 stands of contrasting vegetation structure, from open to very dense and from young regeneration to mature stages. Using a nearby weather station as the macroclimate temperature reference, we calculated the slope (log scale) coefficient of the linear regression between microclimate and macroclimate, as a simple parameter describing the microclimatic buffering (log(slope) {\textless} 0) or amplification (log(slope) {\textgreater} 0) capacity of the habitat. An airborne LiDAR flight was conducted during summer 2021, matching the timing of our temperature measurements. From the resulting 3D point cloud, three complementary metrics of forest structure were derived: the maximum height, the Plant Area Index and the Vertical Complexity Index. They were calculated for circular buffers of different radii (1 m to 100 m) centred on each HOBO sensor. We found that the 5-m radius combining the three metrics into a single multivariate model explained the greatest proportion of variance in the microclimate effect of each stand (R2 = 0.91). We mapped the buffering or amplification effect of vegetation structure on understory temperatures over the entire forest of Blois at a 10-m resolution. 91.4\% of the surface of the forest was significantly buffered relative to macroclimate temperature, while 2.7\% was amplified, especially in road verges, clear-cut and regeneration areas. Based on our simple linear model, we were able to derive understory air temperature maps for any temporal resolution (i.e. hourly, daily, or seasonal). The results highlight the great capacity of airborne LiDAR to retrieve forest structure parameters and generate high-resolution maps of the thermal environment. Applications for mapping the buffering or amplification of microclimate temperature are plentiful, especially in the context of climate change. They include improving the understanding of physiological processes such as thermoregulation or phenology, modelling the thermal connectivity of the landscape, improving species redistribution models, spotting microrefugia for conservation, informing forest management for tree regeneration or wildfire control, or even prioritising cooling recreational areas for humans to escape heatwaves in urban forests.},

	abstract = {Tropical forests have declined in extent considerably owing to large scale deforestation for providing land for multiple uses, and this has reduced their collective capacity to provide many important ecological functions. In the present study, conducted in the tropical island of Sri Lanka, we focus on remnant patches of two common and co-occurring vegetation types in the dry zone, Dry Mixed Evergreen Forest and Scrub Forest, to test (a) whether small remnant forest patches facilitate microclimate buffering and, if so, (b) whether the two forest types differ in terms of their potential to buffer the microclimate, and (c) whether the extent of canopy cover influences the microclimate buffering capacity. Co-occurring Grasslands were used as reference habitats. We used multiple temperature, relative humidity and vapour pressure deficit related metrics, and showed that Dry mixed Evergreen Forest and Scrub Forest had significant microclimate buffering potential, the latter to a lesser extent than the former (Dry mixed Evergreen Forest {\textgreater} Scrub Forest). These results are noteworthy, given that the patches of both forest types were relatively small (mean ± standard deviation: Dry Mixed Evergreen Forest = 0.63 ± 0.13 km2 and Scrub Forest = 0.10 ± 0.07 km2), intermixed and scattered across the same landscape. The study also showed that, after controlling for effects of patch size, the extent of canopy cover had a significant impact on most of the microclimate metrics. The impact of patch size on microclimate metrics was less pronounced. These findings highlight the need for conserving remnant forest patches, especially of the Dry Mixed Evergreen Forest, as refuges of biodiversity, particularly in the context of tropical forests in developing countries facing severe threats of deforestation.},

	abstract = {Forest structural diversity and community composition are key in regulating forest microclimates. When disturbance affects structural diversity or composition, forest microclimates may be altered due to changes in soil temperature, soil water content, and light availability. It is unclear however which structural or compositional components, when changed or to what extent, result in microclimatic change. To address this question, we used data from a large scale, manipulative stem-girdling experiment in northern, lower Michigan—the Forest Resilience and Threshold Experiment (FoRTE). FoRTE follows a factorial design with multiple levels of disturbance severity (0, 45, 65, 85\%) based on targeted reductions in gross leaf area index via stem-girdling induced mortality. These disturbance severity treatments are applied in two ways: either as top-down (largest trees are killed) or bottom-up (small to medium trees killed) treatments. We examined how multiple components of structural diversity and community composition changed as a product of disturbance severity and type, and then tested for resulting effects on forest microclimates (light availability, soil temperature, and soil water), using a multivariate, Random Forest framework. We found that measures of community composition (species richness, species evenness, and Shannon-Wiener Diversity Index) and stand structure (basal area, standard deviation of DBH, tree size diversity) declined more following disturbance than did measures of canopy cover, heterogeneity, arrangement, or height. However, when changes in each variable from pre- to post-disturbance, measured as log change, were employed in a multivariate, Random Forest regression framework, structural diversity measures of heterogeneity (rugosity, top rugosity), cover (canopy cover), and arrangement (porosity) were the most influential variables, but with differences among bottom-up and top-down treatments We found that the death of large trees from disturbance impacts soil temperature, water, and light environments more substantially and uniformly across disturbance gradients than does the death of smaller trees. Our results have implications for both statistical and process-based modeling of forest disturbance.},

	abstract = {The tropical forests in the Amazon store large amounts of carbon and are still considered a carbon sink. There is evidence that deforestation can turn a forest landscape into a carbon source due to land use and forest degradation. Deforestation causes fragmented forest landscapes. It is known from field experiments that forest dynamics at the edge of forest fragments are altered by changes in the microclimate and increased tree mortality (“edge effects”). However, it is unclear how this will affect large fragmented forest landscapes, and thus the entire Amazon region. The aim of this study is to investigate different forest attributes in edge and core forest areas at high resolution, and thus to identify the large-scale impacts of small-scale edge effects. Therefore, a well-established framework combining forest modelling and lidar-generated forest structure information was combined with radar-based forest cover data. Furthermore, forests were also analyzed at the landscape level to investigate changes between highly fragmented and less-fragmented landscapes. This study found that the aboveground biomass in forest edge areas is 27\% lower than in forest core areas. In contrast, the net primary productivity is 13\% higher in forest edge areas than in forest core areas. In the second step, whole fragmented landscapes were analyzed. Nearly 30\% of all forest landscapes are highly fragmented, particularly in the regions of the Arc of Deforestation, on the edge of the Andes and on the Amazon river banks. Less-fragmented landscapes are mainly located in the central Amazon rainforest. The aboveground biomass is 28\% lower in highly fragmented forest landscapes than in less-fragmented landscapes. The net primary productivity is 13\% higher in highly fragmented forest landscapes than in less-fragmented forest landscapes. In summary, fragmentation of the Amazon rainforest has an impact on forest attributes such as biomass and productivity, with mostly negative effects on forest dynamics. If deforestation continues and the proportion of highly fragmented forest landscapes increase, the effect may be even more intense. By combining lidar, radar and forest modelling, this study shows that it is possible to map forest structure, and thus the degree of forest degradation, over a large area and derive more detailed information about the carbon dynamics of the Amazon region.},

	abstract = {Climate data matching the scales at which organisms experience climatic conditions are often missing. Yet, such data on microclimatic conditions are required to better understand climate change impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Here we combine a network of microclimate temperature measurements across different habitats and vertical heights with a novel radiative transfer model to map daily temperatures during the vegetation period at 10 m spatial resolution across Switzerland. Our results reveal strong horizontal and vertical variability in microclimate temperature, particularly for maximum temperatures at 5 cm above the ground and within the topsoil. Compared to macroclimate conditions as measured by weather stations outside forests, diurnal air and topsoil temperature ranges inside forests were reduced by up to 3.0 and 7.8 ∘C, respectively, while below trees outside forests, e.g. in hedges and below solitary trees, this buffering effect was 1.8 and 7.2 ∘C, respectively. We also found that, in open grasslands, maximum temperatures at 5 cm above ground are, on average, 3.4 ∘C warmer than those of the macroclimate, suggesting that, in such habitats, heat exposure close to the ground is often underestimated when using macroclimatic data. Spatial interpolation was achieved by using a hybrid approach based on linear mixed-effect models with input from detailed radiation estimates from radiative transfer models that account for topographic and vegetation shading, as well as other predictor variables related to the macroclimate, topography, and vegetation height. After accounting for macroclimate effects, microclimate patterns were primarily driven by radiation, with particularly strong effects on maximum temperatures. Results from spatial block cross-validation revealed predictive accuracies as measured by root mean squared errors ranging from 1.18 to 3.43 ∘C, with minimum temperatures being predicted more accurately overall than maximum temperatures. The microclimate-mapping methodology presented here enables a biologically relevant perspective when analysing climate–species interactions, which is expected to lead to a better understanding of biotic and ecosystem responses to climate and land use change.},

Definitions of edge, however, vary across studies, with many defining edge a priori and few explicitly measuring the depth of edge influence (DEI). In this study, we aimed to functionally define edge for mantled howler monkey (Alouatta palliata) distribution and howling behaviour in a fragmented rainforest. We surveyed howler monkey locations (walking 11 line transects a total of 253 times in May-August 2015 and 2016) and howling behaviour (584 observation hours across May-August 2017 and 2018) throughout the forest fragment and fit our data to several candidate models to estimate DEI. We found howler monkeys farther from anthropogenic edge and closer to river edge than expected by a random distribution of locations. We estimated DEIs for howl bout rate (bouts/hour), howl bout length, and howling rate per bout (howls/minute per bout) that were different to those used in previous work at this site, suggesting that a priori definitions of edge used in prior work were likely too small to detect edge effects and the methods used provide a more accurate picture of how edges impact these monkeys. Our results provide an example of how using different edge definitions can alter research findings, showing that mathematical methods of determining DEI are warranted. This mathematical approach to examining behavioural edge effects can be applied more broadly across primates to help us better understand how primates respond to edges.},

	abstract = {The forest understory experiences temperature variations that are dampened compared to adjacent open areas, allowing the development of a forest microclimate and associated ecological conditions. It is however unclear to what extent forests will maintain this buffering effect under increasing global warming. Providing reliable projections of future forest microclimates is therefore crucial to anticipate climate change impacts on forest biodiversity, and to identify corresponding conservation strategies. Recent empirical studies suggest that the buffering of air temperature extremes in forest understory compared to open land could increase with global warming, albeit at a slower rate than macroclimate temperatures. Here, we investigate the trend of this temperature buffering effect in a high-emission global warming scenario, using the process-based Land Surface Model CLM5.1. We find biome-dependant buffering trends with strongest values in tropical forests where buffering increases for every degree of global warming by 0.1 ∘C for maximum soil temperature, and by 0.2 ∘C for maximum canopy air temperature. In boreal regions, forest microclimate exhibits a strong seasonality and the effect of global warming is more uncertain. Thus, our results highlight the importance of tropical forest canopies in particular, in maintaining hospitable conditions for understory species while increasing their climate debt under global warming. Our research also illustrates the potential and limitations of Land Surface Models to simulate forest microclimate, and calls for further collaborations between Earth system modelers and ecologists to jointly question climate and biosphere dynamics.},

	abstract = {Many tropical forests are dominated by edge habitat, with consequences for forest structure, carbon stocks, and biodiversity. However, edge effects are highly variable and context-dependent, and are poorly quantified in oil palm landscapes. We studied edge effects in 10 lowland rainforest remnants bordering mature oil palm plantations on Borneo, by surveying 0.2 ha plots along transects running perpendicular to the forest edge (ten 1.6 km transects, 5-6 plots per transect; 57 plots in total). We examined how edge proximity affected plot-level forest structure (canopy cover, number and size of stems ≥10 cm diameter), aboveground carbon stocks, microclimate (air temperature and light intensity), and tree community composition and richness. The largest trees were significantly smaller (up to 21\% reduced diameter) in plots near edges, and plot-level carbon was up to 30\% lower (model-fitted average = 64.7 Mg ha−1 at 50 m from the edge, versus 92.3 Mg ha−1 at 1600 m), with the strongest effects within 300m of edges. However, these significant effects of edge proximity were relatively small in the context of existing variation, with distance-from-edge explaining {\textless}13\% of the total variability in maximum tree size or carbon. In addition, there were generally no effects of edge proximity on any other component of forest structure, composition or diversity, and only a weak effect on microclimate. We conclude that limited edge effects in this system may reflect low structural contrast between forest and mature oil palm, and limited invasion of pioneer trees from plantations, which diminished edge influence in highly heterogeneous forest remnants.

	abstract = {Edge effects occur when the matrix has adverse impacts on the patches of remnant habitat. A widely explored example of this is the hypothesis of a higher predation pressure on bird nests closer to the habitat edge. In parallel with the recent loss of open habitats through afforestation as a climate change mitigation measure, an interest in the impact of forest on species dependent on open habitats has re-emerged. We follow wader nest survival to study the issue of an edge effect in a system of wet grasslands fragmented by forests in a region where it has not been tested before, focussing mainly on northern lapwing (Vanellus vanellus), common ringed plover (Charadrius hiaticula), common redshank (Tringa totanus) and southern dunlin (Calidris alpina schinzii). To record nest survival, we monitored 753 nests of 10 wader species on coastal grasslands in Estonia for 3 consecutive years. A subset (n = 85) of these nests was equipped with camera traps to record nest predation events and predator association with forest edge. The distance to nearest trees and forest and a forest cover within a 1-km buffer around each nest was measured. We recorded extremely low daily nest survival rates (0.903–0.922 for different species), with most nests lost to predation. We showed that nest survival is lower closer to the forest edge and negatively affected by the proportion of forest within a 1-km buffer around each nest. Based on camera trap recordings, we suggest that the edge effect is caused by elevated nest predation rates by the most common predator, the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), closer to the forest edge. Future afforestation plans of open habitats need to acknowledge that the resulting fragmentation has a negative impact on nest survival of ground-breeding birds. On the other hand, our results imply that restoration efforts aimed at removal of most damaging forest plantations could benefit breeding waders.},

	abstract = {In fragmented forests, edge effects can drive intraspecific variation in seedling performance that influences forest regeneration and plant composition. However, few studies have attempted to disentangle the relative biotic and abiotic drivers of intraspecific variation in seedling performance. In this study, we carried out a seedling transplant experiment with a factorial experimental design on three land-bridge islands in the Thousand Island Lake, China, using four common native woody plant species. At different distances from the forest edge (2, 8, 32, 128 m), we transplanted four seedlings of each species into each of three cages: full-cage, for herbivore exclusion; half-cage, that allowed herbivore access but controlled for caging artifacts; and no-cage control. In the 576 cages, we recorded branch architecture, leaf traits, and seedling survival for each seedling before and after the experimental treatment. Overall, after one full growing season, edge-induced abiotic drivers and varied herbivory pressure led to intraspecific variation in seedling performance, including trade-offs in seedling architecture and resource-use strategies. However, responses varied across species with different life-history strategies and depended on the driver in question, such that the abiotic and biotic effects were additive across species, rather than interactive. Edge-induced abiotic variation modified seedling architecture of a shade-tolerant species, leading to more vertical rather than lateral growth at edges. Meanwhile, increased herbivory pressure resulted in a shift toward lower dry matter investment in leaves of a light-demanding species. Our results suggest that edge effects can drive rapid directional shifts in the performance and intraspecific traits of some woody plants from early ontogenetic stages, but most species in this study showed negligible phenotypic responses to edge effects. Moreover, species-specific responses suggest the importance of interspecific differences modulating the degree of trait plasticity, implying the need to incorporate individual-level responses when understanding the impact of forest fragmentation on plant communities.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic disturbance has left the world's forests highly fragmented, with a significant proportion of edge-affected area. Abiotic changes at forest edges are likely to affect forest soil carbon cycling, as higher temperatures and lower moisture availability in edge environments have well-documented effects on soil respiration. The present study sought to quantify persistent changes in soil carbon cycling in the fragmented broadleaf forests of southeastern Pennsylvania. At three sites with {\textgreater}80-year-old forest-field edges, three 100-m transects perpendicular to the edge were established. Monthly measurements of soil respiration, temperature, and moisture were made at fixed distances along each transect throughout the growing season. Soil carbon storage from 0 to 20 cm depth, litter biomass, and decomposition rates were also assessed. Soil respiration was significantly higher at forest edges, relative to the interior, and this effect penetrated 60 m into the forest. Significantly elevated surface soil temperature and decreased soil moisture were also observed in edge environments. Despite elevated soil respiration at the edge, soil carbon storage, litter biomass, and decomposition rates were invariant along edge to interior gradients. The temperature responsiveness of soil respiration was significantly higher in the forest interior (100 m), relative to locations ≤60 m from the edge. Edge effects altering elements of the soil carbon cycle were apparent in the forests of southeastern Pennsylvania, and principally manifest as increased soil respiration rates and decreased temperature responsiveness of soil respiration. Lack of variation in soil carbon pools and decomposition rates from the forest edge to interior suggests that increased soil respiration may be related to changes in root and rhizosphere respiration at the edge. These findings contribute to a growing body of evidence documenting increased soil respiration in the edge environments of temperate broadleaf forests. Discounting the alterations imposed by forest fragmentation on carbon cycling has the potential to produce misleading estimates of land–atmosphere CO2 exchange and terrestrial carbon storage.},

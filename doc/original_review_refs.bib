	abstract = {The clearing and fragmentation of terrestrial ecosystems is commonly acknowledged as a major cause of the decline of biodiversity. These and other predicted responses to habitat fragmentation are derived from theory, which ecologists have tested with empirical approaches ranging from observations to experimental manipulations. These empirical approaches have also identified areas of theory in need of additional development. For example, experimental studies of fragmentation have provided insights such as the key role played by the matrix surrounding fragments, the importance of edge effects, and the impacts of corridors linking fragments with one another. Much less clear, however, is the extent to which these theoretical and empirical studies – while advancing our conceptual understanding of ecological responses to landscape change – help guide management and conservation practice. We review lessons learned from landscape-scale fragmentation experiments and observational studies, present the results of a survey of fragmentation and conservation experts which probed for links and mismatches between fragmentation studies and conservation practice, and discuss how future studies can contribute to conservation practice. Our survey showed that respondents consider fragmentation theory and empirical studies and their findings important for guiding conservation and management practices. The survey also identified that there are disconnects between what is typically studied by fragmentation ecologists and factors that are central to the practice of biodiversity conservation, notably, community-based human dimensions (e.g. economic, social, health issues), policy and governance, ecosystem services, eco-evolutionary responses of species, and interaction of multiple threats to biodiversity and ecosystem processes. We discuss how these disconnects can present opportunities for experiments to continue to provide valuable recommendations for conservation practice in fragmented landscapes.},

	abstract = {As landscapes become increasingly fragmented, research into impacts from disturbance and how edges affect vegetation and community structure has become more important. Descriptive studies on how microclimate changes across sharp transition zones have long existed in the literature and recently more attention has been focused on understanding the dynamic patterns of microclimate associated with forest edges. Increasing concern about forest fragmentation has led to new technologies for modeling forest microclimates. However, forest boundaries pose important challenges to not only microclimate modeling but also sampling regimes in order to capture the diurnal and seasonal dynamic aspects of microclimate along forest edges. We measured microclimatic variables across a sharp boundary from a clearing into primary lowland tropical rainforest at La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica. Dynamic changes in diurnal microclimate were measured along three replicated transects, approximately 30 m in length with data collected every 1 m continuously at 30 min intervals for 24 h with a mobile sensor platform supported by a cable infrastructure. We found that a first-order polynomial fit using piece-wise regression provided the most consistent estimation of the forest edge, relative to the visual edge, although we found no “best” sensing parameter as all measurements varied. Edge location estimates based on daytime net shortwave radiation had less difference from the visual edge than other shortwave measurements, but estimates made throughout the day with downward-facing or net infrared radiation sensors were more consistent and closer to the visual edge than any other measurement. This research contributes to the relatively small number of studies that have directly measured diurnal temporal and spatial patterns of microclimate variation across forest edges and demonstrates the use of a flexible mobile platform that enables repeated, high-resolution measurements of gradients of microclimate.},

More frequent natural disturbances also increase the presence of edges in forest ecosystems. Studying a mountain landscape in the Eastern Alps, we contrasted 661 plots situated at varying distances from a stand edge with 615 plots sampled in forest interiors. Our objectives were (1) to analyze the strength of edge effects on forest structure, functioning, and diversity; (2) to determine the penetration depth of edge effects into the forest interior; and (3) to quantify the difference between permanent edges (i.e., to a different land cover type) and transient edges (as created e.g., by natural disturbances). Edges affected forest biomass accumulation negatively (basal area, litter depth, live tree carbon), but had positive effects on diversity (variation in tree diameter, effective plant species number, plant species richness, number of red-listed plant species). Biodiversity indicators responded most strongly to the presence of edges. The maximum distance of a significant edge effect was {\textless}50 m across all indicators. Effects on forest structure and functioning were generally stronger at transient edges compared to permanent edges. Our findings highlight that both permanent and transient edges have a considerable influence on forest ecosystems and should be considered more explicitly in the analysis and management of forest landscapes.},

	abstract = {Growing awareness of the role of enemies in plant community dynamics has led to ecologists exploring how plant-enemy interactions change in human-modified systems. Proximity to forest edges was found to weaken the role of two groups of plant enemies—insect herbivores and fungal pathogens—in increasing plant diversity during the seed-to-seedling transition. However, it is less clear whether edge effects similarly compromise the diversifying effects of fungi and insects on established seedlings. We examined this question in a human-modified wet tropical forest in the Western Ghats of southern India. Over an annual cycle of recruitment, in 730 seedling plots (1 × 1 m each) arrayed at distances 0–100 m from the forest edge across 15 locations in a 30 km2 landscape, we suppressed the activity of fungal pathogens and insect herbivores by applying fungicide and insecticide to soil, seeds, and seedlings in a subset of plots. Suppressing fungi and insects reduced diversity mainly for seedling recruits and not for seedlings that had already established. However, pesticide effects were only apparent at 90–100 m from forest edges. Specifically, in the interior sites, fungi and insect activity increased recruit diversity, which helped maintain local seedling diversity even though diversity of established seedlings declined with annual mortality. By comparison, canopy openness affected neither the diversity of survivors from the initial seedling cohort nor total seedling diversity after an annual cycle of recruitment. Our results indicate that insects and fungi promote diversity more prominently during early seedling establishment rather than through impacts on post-establishment seedling survival. Thus, edge effects can weaken the diversifying effects of plant-insect and plant-fungal interactions during recruitment and thereby modify the seedling template available for the future tree community in human-modified forests.},

We examined the influence of three types of surrounding vegetation (cattle pastures, Cecropia-dominated regrowth, and Vismia-dominated regrowth), on edge-related tree mortality in Amazonian rainforest fragments. An ANCOVA revealed that the type of surrounding vegetation and distance to edge both had significant effects on tree mortality. Differences among vegetation types were greatest within 0–20 m of fragment edges, with edges bordered by cattle pastures having higher mortality than those bordered by Cecropia- and Vismia-dominated regrowth. Edge effects appeared to penetrate further into pasture-bordered edges (ca. 60–100 m) than those bordered by regrowth forest (ca. 40–60 m), but this difference was nonsignificant because of considerable patchiness in tree mortality. Overall, our results suggest that edge effects in forest fragments are significantly influenced by the structure of surrounding vegetation, and that the capacity of different regrowth forests to buffer edge effects can be predicted from the growth form and stand features of the dominant tree species. Management of surrounding vegetation can ameliorate the negative effects of edge creation on small forest fragments.},

We show that the abundances of 85\% of species are affected, either positively or negatively, by forest edges. Species that live in the centre of the forest (forest core), that were more likely to be listed as threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), reached peak abundances only at sites farther than 200–400 m from sharp high-contrast forest edges. Smaller-bodied amphibians, larger reptiles and medium-sized non-volant mammals experienced a larger reduction in suitable habitat than other forest-core species.

The Core-Area Model accurately estimates the total area of pristine habitat contained within fragments. Moreover, it can be used to predict the amount of unaltered habitat preserved within any hypothetical fragment, such as a planned park or nature reserve, regardless of its size or shape. The model is simple, requiring two edge function parameters and the area and perimeter length of the fragment. Model simulations revealed that for any edge-sensitive species and habitat type there exists a critical range of fragment sizes in which the impacts of edge effects increase almost exponentially. This critical size range cannot be predicted without empirical measurement of the edge function.},

A synthesis of fragmentation experiments spanning multiple biomes and scales, five continents, and 35 years demonstrates that habitat fragmentation reduces biodiversity by 13 to 75\% and impairs key ecosystem functions by decreasing biomass and altering nutrient cycles. Effects are greatest in the smallest and most isolated fragments, and they magnify with the passage of time. These findings indicate an urgent need for conservation and restoration measures to improve landscape connectivity, which will reduce extinction rates and help maintain ecosystem services.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT
            We investigated the influence of a four-year-old forest edge near Manaus, Brazil, on soil moisture and vertical profiles of air vapour pressure deficit (VPD) within the forest. Soil moisture was measured (with a neutron probe) 0, 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 150 and 200 m into the forest from the edge, in undisturbed control areas, and in the pasture. Control soil moisture was better explained by rainfall in the previous 2 or 10 days than by longer-term totals. Soil water potentials ≤ – 1.5 MPa occurred at some forest locations during the driest period. The variation in soil moisture with distance from the forest edge was complex, with higher values just inside the edge and depleted zones at the edge and 40–80 m inside it. At a given height, VPD (standardized relative to measurements in the open) was not related to distance from the edge, but VPD increased more with height near the edge than in control areas. The complexity of the edge's influence and the contrast with earlier data from the same edge can be explained by the changing vegetation structure near the edge. Regrowth ‘seals’ the edge with more leaves that transpire and deplete soil moisture, while protecting the understorey just inside the edge from desiccating conditions. A mosaic of gaps of differing ages develops behind the edge, increasing the variation in microclimatic conditions near the ground and consequently in evapotranspiration and soil moisture.},

Although initially designed to assess the influence of fragment area on Amazonian biotas, the project has yielded insights that go far beyond the original scope of the study. Results suggest that edge effects play a key role in fragment dynamics, that the matrix has a major influence on fragment connectivity and functioning, and that many Amazonian species avoid even small ({\textless}100-m-wide) clearings. The effects of fragmentation are highly eclectic, altering species richness and abundances, species invasions, forest dynamics, the trophic structure of communities, and a variety of ecological and ecosystem processes. Moreover, forest fragmentation appears to interact synergistically with ecological changes such as hunting, fires, and logging, collectively posing an even greater threat to the rainforest biota.},

Theory has emphasized the spatial aspects of fragmentation and the role of dispersal among patches, and has generated interesting predictions such as a nonlinear relationship between the amount of remaining habitat and the probability of species persistence. However, while the few available large-scale empirical studies of fragmentation all tend to show that it has major effects, these documented effects tend to be relatively simple ones such as the degradation of habitat quality within fragments. There is good reason to be cautious of any claim that corridors or the spatial configuration of remaining habitat can compensate for the overall loss of habitat.

	abstract = {Habitat fragmentation studies have produced complex results that are challenging to synthesize. Inconsistencies among studies may result from variation in the choice of landscape metrics and response variables, which is often compounded by a lack of key statistical or methodological information. Collating primary datasets on biodiversity responses to fragmentation in a consistent and flexible database permits simple data retrieval for subsequent analyses. We present a relational database that links such field data to taxonomic nomenclature, spatial and temporal plot attributes, and environmental characteristics. Field assessments include measurements of the response(s) (e.g., presence, abundance, ground cover) of one or more species linked to plots in fragments within a partially forested landscape. The database currently holds 9830 unique species recorded in plots of 58 unique landscapes in six of eight realms: mammals 315, birds 1286, herptiles 460, insects 4521, spiders 204, other arthropods 85, gastropods 70, annelids 8, platyhelminthes 4, Onychophora 2, vascular plants 2112, nonvascular plants and lichens 320, and fungi 449. Three landscapes were sampled as long-term time series ({\textgreater}10 years). Seven hundred and eleven species are found in two or more landscapes. Consolidating the substantial amount of primary data available on biodiversity responses to fragmentation in the context of land-use change and natural disturbances is an essential part of understanding the effects of increasing anthropogenic pressures on land. The consistent format of this database facilitates testing of generalizations concerning biologic responses to fragmentation across diverse systems and taxa. It also allows the re-examination of existing datasets with alternative landscape metrics and robust statistical methods, for example, helping to address pseudo-replication problems. The database can thus help researchers in producing broad syntheses of the effects of land use. The database is dynamic and inclusive, and contributions from individual and large-scale data-collection efforts are welcome.},

Whilst LMMs offer a flexible approach to modelling a broad range of data types, ecological data are often complex and require complex model structures, and the fitting and interpretation of such models is not always straightforward. The ability to achieve robust biological inference requires that practitioners know how and when to apply these tools. Here, we provide a general overview of current methods for the application of LMMs to biological data, and highlight the typical pitfalls that can be encountered in the statistical modelling process. We tackle several issues regarding methods of model selection, with particular reference to the use of information theory and multi-model inference in ecology. We offer practical solutions and direct the reader to key references that provide further technical detail for those seeking a deeper understanding. This overview should serve as a widely accessible code of best practice for applying LMMs to complex biological problems and model structures, and in doing so improve the robustness of conclusions drawn from studies investigating ecological and evolutionary questions.},

	abstract = {Anurans have been affected by Andean forest fragmentation and loss, leading to impoverished ensembles along the pasture-forest gradients. We evaluated edge effects on tropical cloud forest anurans in three landscapes with a different degree of anthropogenic disturbance, and their relationships with eight environmental variables. On each landscape we set up 12 permanent transects (two per habitat type: streams in pastures, pastures, the outer limit of the pastures with the forest, the internal edge of the forest, the forest interior and streams inside the forest) and surveyed them using an equal effort. After an effort of 162 man-hours we recorded a total of 251 anurans of eight species. Richness was higher in the forest (seven species) than in pasture (four species). Most species of the ensemble (75\%) inhabited the forest habitats, whereas 50\% of the anuran species inhabited the pasture. Slope and distance to streams inﬂuenced the distribution of all modeled Pristimantis species, although this genus exhibits direct development and doesn’t require bodies of water for its reproduction. The canopy cover had a high explanatory power (through beta regressors) on the presence of anuran species in the microhabitat; whereas temperature and relative humidity did not, suggesting that temperature and relative humidity may be less important for frog distributions along pasture-forest gradients in cloud forest landscapes. The anthropogenic disturbance in the landscape, rather than the edge effects, affects the presence of two rare species (Pristimantis ptochus and Pristimantis kelephas) suggesting that these species display a high degree of sensitivity to the transformation of the cloud forest. Future cloud forest management research needs to incorporate anthropogenic disturbance effects, because it strongly interacts with edge and matrix effects, affecting the habitat quality and the persistence of species in the landscape.},

However, it still has the highest richness of palms in this state, which constitute an important and economically relevant group. Environmental and demographic aspects of plant populations in forest fragments are of great importance for their management and conservation. We conducted a study on the spatial distribution and age structure of five palm species in a forest fragment at the municipality of Três Cachoeiras, in the north coast of Rio Grande do Sul. We delimited 25 10×10 m plots and counted the number of individuals in the stages of seedling, juvenile and adult for each palm species. Aggregation Indices were calculated with software SADIEShell. We performed variation partitioning analyses among species distribution and environmental variables canopy openness and soil moisture. A total of 1,443 plants were counted and the most abundant species was Euterpe edulis. The average density was of 57.72 ind. 100 m-2. Three species showed a pattern of "inverse J", which indicated that they have a potential for regenerating in that palm community. The predominant spatial pattern was aggregated (Ia{\textgreater}1) and canopy openness did not influence species abundances. Only the distribution of Bactris setosa and Geonoma gamiova, both understory species, was explained by soil moisture, suggesting that other abiotic or biotic factors may be influencing the spatial arrangement of the canopy species.},

	abstract = {The model selection literature has been generally poor at reflecting the deep foundations of the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and at making appropriate comparisons to the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). There is a clear philosophy, a sound criterion based in information theory, and a rigorous statistical foundation for AIC. AIC can be justified as Bayesian using a “savvy” prior on models that is a function of sample size and the number of model parameters. Furthermore, BIC can be derived as a non-Bayesian result. Therefore, arguments about using AIC versus BIC for model selection cannot be from a Bayes versus frequentist perspective. The philosophical context of what is assumed about reality, approximating models, and the intent of model-based inference should determine whether AIC or BIC is used. Various facets of such multimodel inference are presented here, particularly methods of model averaging.},

	abstract = {How climate affects species distributions is a longstanding question receiving renewed interest owing to the need to predict the impacts of global warming on biodiversity. Is climate change forcing species to live near their critical thermal limits? Are these limits likely to change through natural selection? These and other important questions can be addressed with models relating geographical distributions of species with climate data, but inferences made with these models are highly contingent on non-climatic factors such as biotic interactions. Improved understanding of climate change effects on species will require extensive analysis of thermal physiological traits, but such data are both scarce and scattered. To overcome current limitations, we created the GlobTherm database. The database contains experimentally derived species’ thermal tolerance data currently comprising over 2,000 species of terrestrial, freshwater, intertidal and marine multicellular algae, plants, fungi, and animals. The GlobTherm database will be maintained and curated by iDiv with the aim to keep expanding it, and enable further investigations on the effects of climate on the distribution of life on Earth.},

	abstract = {Forest biodiversity and ecosystem services are hitherto predominantly quantified in forest interiors, well away from edges. However, these edges also represent a substantial proportion of the global forest cover. Here we quantified plant biodiversity and ecosystem service indicators in 225 plots along forest edge-to-interior transects across Europe. We found strong trade-offs: phylogenetic diversity (evolutionary measure of biodiversity), proportion of forest specialists, decomposition and heatwave buffering increased towards the interior, whereas species richness, nectar production potential, stemwood biomass and tree regeneration decreased. These trade-offs were mainly driven by edge-to-interior structural differences. As fragmentation continues, recognizing the role of forest edges is crucial for integrating biodiversity and ecosystem service considerations into sustainable forest management and policy. In an analysis of forest edge-to-interior transects in Europe, the authors show that different facets of biodiversity and different types of ecosystem service are found in forest interiors versus edges, suggesting that both have a role to play in the provisioning of ecosystem services in landscapes.},

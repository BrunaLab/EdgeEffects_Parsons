Microclimate, vegetation, and shrub and leaf-litter arthropods were sampled at south-facing forest edges and interiors of three sites within each landscape. Forest edges in the agricultural landscape were older and had vegetation structures that differed from those in the forestry landscape. This resulted in a sharper contrast in microclimate (temperature and humidity) between edge and interior in forests abutting agriculture than in stands abutting recent clearcuts. Arthropods from the leaf-litter and shrub-layer samples exhibited different responses to edges. In both landscapes, total shrub-arthropod abundance was not significantly affected by edges, while total leaf-litter arthropod abundance was lower at edges than in forest interiors. This reduced abundance of leaf-litter arthropods could negatively affect birds and other insectivorous vertebrates or could have been caused by greater vertebrate predation there. Forest edges in agriculture and forestry landscapes represent relative extremes in edge maturity, demonstrating that age of edges cannot completely mitigate edge effects on microclimate and abundance of arthropods. We discuss the implications of our findings for influences of forest fragmentation and landscape change on forest birds.},

This paper describes short-term eects of edge creation on woody seedling dynamics in an Amazonian lowland rainforest, using data collected between nine months before and 16 months after creation of an abrupt forest-pasture edge. Starting in December 1989, recruitment, mortality, and growth of plants 4250 cm tall were monitored in plots located in the interior and at 5, 10, 25, 50, 100 and 250 m from the edge of a 100-ha forest fragment. In each plot, temperature and relative humidity were measured three times, while hemispherical photographs were taken after edge creation to estimate vegetation cover. Seedling recruitment increased along transects at 5 and 10 m from the edge following edge creation; pioneer species (especially Cecropia spp.) were recruited up to 10 m from the edge where they had previously been absent. Seedling mortality did not increase following edge formation. Seedlings within 10 m of the edge exhibited accelerated vertical growth, with a logarithmic decline in the eect with distance from the edge. Increased vertical growth was most pronounced for plants recruited at about the time of edge formation. Temperature and vapor pressure de®cit were elevated following edge formation to ca. 50 m into the forest, and both declined exponentially with distance from the edge. Over the ®rst 15 months following edge creation, recruitment and growth of woody seedlings was increased only up to 10 m from new edges, and mortality was unchanged, suggesting that the edge eect for woody seedlings was only about 10 m wide. \# 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

	abstract = {While edge microclimates are well described for closed forests, they remain under-examined in more sparse vegetation types like the temperate woodlands of south-eastern Australia. This limits predictions of edge effects on remnant vegetation in cleared agricultural landscapes, and of changes in these effects with reforestation. Using ﬁxed and roving weather stations, we examined inﬂuences on temperate woodland microclimate of adjoining land use (agriculture versus tree plantation), distance from edge (0–150 m), and woodland structural attributes (canopy openness, stem density and basal area). Shading by plantations signiﬁcantly decreased temperatures and vapour pressure deﬁcit (VPD) at woodland edges in winter (up to 0.8 ◦C and 75 Pa relative to agricultural edges). However, this effect was reversed in the non-winter months, when daytime temperatures and VPD were generally greater at plantation than agricultural edges (up to 0.5 ◦C and 300 Pa). This was the opposite of edge-type effects recorded for closed-forest types, and was explained by lower wind speeds at plantation edges, which led to the accumulation of heat in the 25 m ﬁrebreak between the two land uses. A similar ‘dead zone’ also apparently contributed to cooler, moister night-time conditions at plantation edges. Consistent with closed forests, and irrespective of edge type and season, we measured a depth of edge inﬂuence of 40–50 m for daytime temperature and VPD. However, magnitude of edge inﬂuence (ca. 0.5 ◦C and 100 Pa) was much less than in closed forests, and woodland interiors were warmer and drier than edges, whereas closed-forest interiors are usually cooler and moister than edges. This unique microclimate gradient into woodlands was explained both by decreasing wind speeds, and by positive relationships of temperature and VPD with basal area and stem density, highlighting the role of sub-canopy heat sinks like tree trunks in regulating interior microclimates of sparse vegetation types.},

We sought to assess whether seasonal inundation of these small swamps results in a hydrologic switch in which the presence of standing water overwhelms the eﬀects of edge distance on microclimate variation. Hydrology does appear to exert substantial control over the edge eﬀect on microclimate, but the eﬀects of distance from the edge remained discernable during periods of inundation. We also studied the eﬀects of a wildﬁre that occurred 2 y before data collection. We expected to ﬁnd warmer and drier conditions in domes aﬀected by recent ﬁre. Contrary to our expectations, previously burned domes were either similar to unburned domes or, in some cases, cooler and more humid than unburned domes, possibly because of vigorous regrowth after ﬁre in these highly productive, ﬁre-adapted subtropical ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Understanding edge effects in different remnants of natural vegetation is crucialfor the management of many fragmented landscapes. We compared edges of different wooded habitats in afragmented tropical rainforest in Los Tuxtlas, Veracruz, Mexico. Selected habitats in a pasture matrix included four forest fragments ({\textgreater}50 ha), four linear forest remnants along streams (riparian forest), and eight isolated remnant forest trees (fourfenced andfour withoutfences). Edge habitats were defined in terms of microclimate, vegetation structure, and floristic composition. In forest-pasture sites, significant edge effects were detected for some variables, but depth of influence varied. Compared to the other habitats, riparian sites and isolated trees withoutfences exhibited distinct edge conditions. Isolated trees fencedfor 54 months, however, exhibited some microenvironmental conditions similar to those of forest interior. In total, 244 woody plant species were recorded in the sampled area ({\textless}1 ha), and these represented 56\% of woody species reportedfor Los Tuxtlas reserve. Only two species, Acalypha diversifolia and Siparuna andina, occurred in the interior, edge, and pasture of all studied landscape units. Twelve species occurred in all edges and pastures (e.g., Acacia mayana, Tabemrnaemontana arborea, Cupania glabra, Stemmadenia donnell-smithii). Twenty-six species were found exclusively at edges, whereas 44 species were recorded only in interiors. Fenced, isolated trees can provide a suitable habitat for the establishment of several primary-forest trees (e.g., Nectandra spp.). Many primary-forest species were found in the fragmented habitats we studied, suggesting that these species are not lost in fragmented landscapes and that plant diversity loss is probably proceeding slowly. Collectively, riparian strips and isolated trees in a pasture matrix could effectively function as a focus for rainforest regeneration. Riparian strips and trees, therefore, need to be incorporated into landscape designs for maintaining and enhancing ecological diversity.},

WKHs are often quite small (from 0.1 to a few hectares) and thus it is unclear if they can maintain biodiversity. We studied the effects of WKH size, microclimate and forest structure on species richness and composition of polypores, a group of wood-decaying fungi that has become threatened due to clear-cut forestry. The WKHs studied varied in size between 0.05 and 3.6 ha, and the control forests from 6.5 to 44.7 ha. Patch size and the volumes of logs and standing dead trees signiﬁcantly affected the total number of species per study plot, with patches {\textless}0.5 ha having lower total species richness than larger patches. The relationship between species richness and patch size was linear, but the relationships between log volume and species parameters were nonlinear, with the increase in the total number of species and the number of red-listed and indicator species levelling off at the volumes of 20–30 m3 haÀ1. We detected a signiﬁcant edge inﬂuence on humidity up to 50 m into the forest interior, indicating that patches {\textless}1 ha are subject to a climatic edge effect in their entirety. Humidity difference was also the main factor affecting species assemblages, as revealed by Canonical Correspondence Analysis. We conclude that (1) the volume of logs is crucial for the diversity of polypores in WKHs, (2) species richness and number of red-listed species increase with increasing dead wood volume up to 20–30 m3 haÀ1, (3) an edge effect impacts humidity up to 50 m into the forest interior in newly created edges in boreal spruce forests, (4) patch size inﬂuences total species richness of polypores, probably through microclimate and dispersal potential from nearby sources in larger patches, (5) the combined inﬂuence of the edge effect and reduced amount of dead wood in the future due to present forest structure indicate that patches {\textless}1 ha cannot maintain full species diversity of polypores in the long term.},

Our main objective was to take a critical look at the role of forest regrowth in mitigating the initial edge effects on microclimate and understory vegetation in northern hardwood forests of the eastern United States. We compared canopy closure, hourly air temperature, soil moisture, and understory vegetation at increasing distances from forest edges (0, 5, 10, 20, and 30 m) along twelve transects placed across new and older forest edges (3–4 or 16–19 years old) created by forest harvest. Open, new forest edges exhibited pronounced edge effects on microclimate and shade-intolerant plants, but these were almost completely moderated by forest regrowth on the cleared side of older edges where dense young forest developed with a new canopy comparable in cover to adjacent mature forest. There were no initial edge effects on shade-tolerant vegetation across new forest edges, but the shade-tolerant vegetation declined in mature forest near old forest edges adjacent to dense young forest that supported only sparse understory vegetation. These delayed secondary edge effects of young dense forests on adjacent mature forests have not been previously documented and they should be more explicitly included in forest management considerations. We suggest an integrated system for managing and mitigating both the immediate primary and delayed secondary edge effects in those working forest landscapes where biodiversity conservation is of high priority.},

	abstract = {Forest conservation and restoration are global priorities because of the wide variety of environmental services that these ecosystems provide, but achieving these goals depends on our knowledge about the factors driving tree recruitment. Tree establishment within forests is promoted by favorable microclimatic conditions, but seedlings in this habitat can be subjected to elevated consumer pressure by vertebrates. Conversely, while predation is usually reduced in neighboring human matrices, severe microclimatic conditions can reduce seedling survival in these habitats. Unfavorable microclimatic conditions can be ameliorated at forest edges and this may increase tree establishment rates, as compared to those in human matrices. However, seedlings at forest edges are exposed to predators from both habitats and consumer pressure may be even higher than within the forest. Thus, tree establishment in human-disturbed forests seems to depend on tradeoffs between microclimate and predation. This study focused on these issues in an oak forest from Mexico where extensive forested areas have been replaced by plantations of the exotic tree Eucalyptus camaldulensis. For this, two experiments were conducted by transplanting oak seedlings within the forest, at the forest edge and in a neighboring plantation. Temperature, air humidity and light intensity were measured in all habitats during the experiments. The ﬁrst experiment assessed the effect of microclimate on seedling survival and, therefore, transplants were protected with wire cages to prevent predation by vertebrates. Survival of seedlings was monitored during a year and their physiological responses to microclimate were assessed by measuring their photosynthetic efﬁciency. In the second experiment, seedlings were not protected from herbivores and these survival data were used to discriminate between the effects of microclimate and predation. Temperature and light intensity decreased from the Eucalyptus plantation toward the forest interior, while relative humidity increased in that direction. The physiological performance and survival rates of protected seedlings increased from the plantation toward the forest, suggesting that local microclimate largely inﬂuences oak recruitment across these habitat types. Nevertheless, predation rates also increased from the plantation to the forest, suggesting that seedling consumers strongly reduce oak recruitment both within the forest and its edge. These results indicate that the relative importance of physical stress and seedling predation vary across the environmental gradients that compose human-disturbed forests. Thus, restoration and conservation actions should implement speciﬁc protection mechanisms addressed to reduce the impact of the main sources of seedling mortality at each particular habitat of these landscapes.},

	abstract = {A major aim of sustainable forest management is the maintenance or recolonisation of harvested areas by species that were present pre-disturbance. Forest inﬂuence (a type of edge effect that focuses on the effect of mature forests on adjacent disturbed forest) is considered to be an important factor that contributes to the ability of mature forest species to re-colonise disturbed areas. Forest inﬂuence occurs in two main ways by: (1) by providing a source of propagules or individuals for recolonisation; and (2) by its inﬂuence on the biotic and abiotic conditions of the disturbed forest. This study focuses on forest inﬂuence’s impact on microclimate conditions of adjacent disturbed areas regenerating after harvesting. In particular, the study investigates whether microclimate within a regenerating forest changes with increasing distance from a mature forest edge, and whether the magnitude of microclimatic change varies over diurnal, seasonal and successional time scales.},

This is an important consideration for managers, because gradients in microclimate can signiﬁcant affect the ability of species to recolonise following disturbance. One harvesting method that can increase the amount of forest inﬂuence is aggregated retention. This technique involves leaving groups of trees (aggregates) within the harvested area, thus increasing the amount of regenerating forest that is near to an edge and therefore under forest inﬂuence. However, differences in the scale of forest inﬂuence generated from aggregates compared to unlogged forests surrounding harvested areas have not been tested. Understanding the ability of retained aggregates to generate forest inﬂuence is important in designing and implementing aggregated retention harvesting practices.},

The study of the interaction between edge and matrix effects in nature is essential to understand and promote the colonization of some functional groups in managed ecosystems. We studied the dynamics of 7 species of frogs and salamanders occurring in 8 ecotones of tropical montane cloud forest (TMCF) which interact with adjacent managed areas of coffee and corn plantations in Guerrero, southern Mexico. A survey effort of 196 man/hours along 72 transects detected 58 individuals of 7 amphibian species and 12 environmental and structural variables were measured. The diversity and abundance of amphibians in the forest mostly depended on the matrix context adjacent to the forest patches. The forest interior provided higher relative humidity, leaf litter cover, and canopy cover that determined the presence of some amphibian species. The use of shaded coffee plantations was preferred by the amphibians over the corn plots possibly due to the maintenance of native forest arboreal elements, low management rate and less intensity of disturbance in the coffee plantations than in the corn plots. Shaded coffee plantations reduce the edge effects in TMCF, improve the connectivity between TMCF fragments and increase habitat quality for the forest interior amphibian species. Future wildlife management research should take into account edge and matrix effects to understand species dynamics which move along anthropogenic-natural ecotones in managed ecosystems, thus prioritizing sites to buffer edge effects and increase habitat quality in remaining natural ecosystems.},

To enhance generality of this study’s results, we used two edges with contrasting exposure and slope. Measurements in the exterior, interior, and presumed edge zone were taken to capture the full extent of environmental change. A nonlinear segmented regression model revealed a significant edge zone for several factors. At the northeast-facing site, zones for all factors measured were entirely external to the forest vegetation sidewall. At the northwest-facing site, edge zones of solar noon and maximum air temperatures and relative humidity were located primarily outside the sidewall, while edge zones of photosynthetically active radiation and soil temperature were displaced toward the forest interior. Different edge effects were spatially displaced from one another, and their location was consistent with differences in forest exposure and aspect, confirming certain expectations of edge theory. However, the occurrence of all or much of edge zones of several factors outside the forest understory boundary, depending on site, suggests a refinement to edge theory that has important implications for management and restoration in fragmented landscapes.},

	abstract = {Boundaries between habitats are usually accompanied by transitions in the diversity and structural complexity of insect assemblages. Edge effects on carabid beetle assemblages across forest-meadow ecotones in Dinaric beech-fir forests were determined in the Gorski Kotar region of western Croatia. Carabid beetles were sampled using pitfall traps set along gradients extending 60 m from the forest edge into its interior and 60 m into the meadow. Embedded forest edges were greater than 100 years old and had a similar composition and structure of vegetation to that in the adjacent forest. A total of 20,526 individuals belonging to 66 carabid beetle species were recorded. Carabid assemblages in the ecotones were more similar to those in the forest interiors than those in the meadows. The classical edge effect hypothesis was not supported, since the ecotones were less diverse than the meadows, while the carabid assemblages of the forest interiors were the least diverse. Soil temperature, soil humidity and light intensity did not differ significantly between the ecotones and the forest interior. Therefore, embedded forest edges reduced the microclimate edge effect by providing stable microclimatic conditions for carabid assemblages similar to those in the forest interior. In addition, this enabled forest specialists and generalists to occur right up to the forest edge and maintain stable populations in the ecotone. On the other hand, ecotones acted as filters for certain forest generalist species and true barriers for most open-habitat species. This study confirmed that the structure and ages of the vegetation at edges may play a key role in determining the spatial pattern of carabid beetles across forest-meadow ecotones.},

Soil moisture was measured (with a neutron probe) 0, 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 150 and 200 m into the forest from the edge, in undisturbed control areas, and in the pasture. Control soil moisture was better explained by rainfall in the previous 2 or 10 days than by longer-term totals. Soil water potentials -- 1.5 MPa occurred at some forest locations during the driest period. The variation in soil moisture with distance from the forest edge was complex, with higher values just inside the edge and depleted zones at the edge and 40-80 m inside it. At a given height, VPD (standardized relative to measurements in the open) was not related to distance from the edge, but VPD increased more with height near the edge than in control areas. The complexity of the edge's influence and the contrast with earlier data from the same edge can be explained by the changing vegetation structure near the edge. Regrowth 'seals' the edge with more leaves that transpire and deplete soil moisture, while protecting the understorey just inside the edge from desiccating conditions. A mosaic of gaps of differing ages develops behind the edge, increasing the variation in microclimatic conditions near the ground and consequently in evapotranspiration and soil moisture.},

Edge effects may also be important in other situations, such as linear clearings (e.g. along roads, power lines or train tracks). We tested for responses of small mammals to a narrow (c.  m) linear clearing created by a railway in the largest area of Atlantic Forest in southern Brazil. Only two environmental variables, light intensity and train noise, were greatest at the edge and decreased with distance from the edge. Temperature differed (greater extremes and more variable) only at the edge itself. The few small mammal species that were only rarely captured at the edge resulted in an apparent edge-effect with respect to species richness. The abundance of small mammals, however, was independent of distance from the railway. There was no correlation between resource availability at the tracks and abundance of small mammals. Edge effects were minimal, which suggests that narrow railways (in contrast with roads) in unfragmented landscapes probably do not have a significant impact (if any) on wildlife, as found elsewhere and especially in tropical forests. The use of railways instead of roads is a potential strategy to minimize the effects of traversing important habitats for commercial reasons.},

	abstract = {Edge is an important landscape feature of fragmented forest landscapes in the Pacific Northwest, USA. Our primary objective of this study is to characterize the changes in microclimatic variables from recent clearcut edges into the old-growth Douglasfir forests as influenced by edge exposures and local weather conditions. Microclimatic gradients are described along transects extending from recently clearcut edges 240 m into stands of old-growth Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) forest west of the Cascade Range in the U.S. Pacific Northwest. Data for air temperature, soil temperature, relative humidity, short-wave radiation, and wind speed were collected over the course of the day from 16 different edges representing a range of edge orientations and local weather conditions over two growing seasons (1989-1990). Data for soil moisture were collected over three consecutive days in September 1990. Two indices, significance of edge influence (SEI) and depth of edge influence (DEI), were used to evaluate the effects of edges on microclimatic variables. Edge effects typically extended 30 to {\textgreater}240 m into the forest. From the edge into the forest, air temperatures decreased during the day and increased at night; the reversal produced mid-morning and late-afternoon periods when a gradient was absent. Changes in soil temperature from the edge into the forest were comparable to those for air temperature, except that edge effects did not extend as deeply into the forest. The gradient for relative humidity increased from the edge and was steepest in mid-afternoon. Humidity effects sometimes extended {\textgreater}240 m into the forest. Short-wave radiation decreased rapidly with distance from the edge, reaching interior forest levels by 30-60 m. Wind speed decreased exponentially from the edge into the forest, depending on the relationship of edge orientation to wind direction; stronger winds influenced conditions deeper inside the forest, sometimes {\textgreater}240 m from the edge. Edge orientation played a critical role for all variables; for air and soil temperature and humidity, it affected the times of day at which maximum and minimum values peaked. Influence of local weather conditions on gradients was highly variable. Overall, however, gradients generally were longest and steepest on partially clear, warm, dry days, at southwest-facing edges, and for air temperature, soil temperature, and relative humidity. SEI and DEI were found to be necessary measurements for evaluating edge effects on microclimatic variables, which responded differently depending on time of day, edge orientation, and local weather. No single value could be calculated for DEI. Because many ecological features near edges, such as tree stocking and regeneration, dispersal of flying insects, and decomposition of woody debris, seem related to microclimatic gradients, forest management to protect interior conditions should shift from the traditional charge ("create as much edge as possible") to a new charge in which the amount of edge is reduced at both the stand and landscape levels.},

	abstract = {Forests around the world are increasingly fragmented, and edge effects on forest microclimates have the potential to affect ecosystem functions such as carbon and nutrient cycling. Edges tend to be drier and warmer due to the effects of insolation, wind, and evapotranspiration and these gradients can penetrate hundreds of metres into the forest. Litter decomposition is a key component of the carbon cycle, which is largely controlled by saprotrophic fungi that respond to variation in temperature and moisture. However, the impact of forest fragmentation on litter decay is poorly understood. Here, we investigate edge effects on the decay of wood in a temperate forest using an experimental approach, whereby mass loss in wood blocks placed along 100 m transects from the forest edge to core was monitored over 2 years. Decomposition rate increased with distance from the edge, and was correlated with increasing humidity and moisture content of the decaying wood, such that the decay constant at 100 m was nearly twice that at the edge. Mean air temperature decreased slightly with distance from the edge. The variation in decay constant due to edge effects was larger than that expected from any reasonable estimates of climatic variation, based on a published regional model. We modelled the inﬂuence of edge effects on the decay constant at the landscape scale using functions for forest area within different distances from edge across the UK. We found that taking edge effects into account would decrease the decay rate by nearly one quarter, compared with estimates that assumed no edge effect.},

	abstract = {Anurans have been affected by Andean forest fragmentation and loss, leading to impoverished ensembles along the pasture-forest gradients. We evaluated edge effects on tropical cloud forest anurans in three landscapes with a different degree of anthropogenic disturbance, and their relationships with eight environmental variables. On each landscape we set up 12 permanent transects (two per habitat type: streams in pastures, pastures, the outer limit of the pastures with the forest, the internal edge of the forest, the forest interior and streams inside the forest) and surveyed them using an equal effort. After an effort of 162 man-hours we recorded a total of 251 anurans of eight species. Richness was higher in the forest (seven species) than in pasture (four species). Most species of the ensemble (75\%) inhabited the forest habitats, whereas 50\% of the anuran species inhabited the pasture. Slope and distance to streams influenced the distribution of all modeled Pristimantis species, although this genus exhibits direct development and doesn’t require bodies of water for its reproduction. The canopy cover had a high explanatory power (through beta regressors) on the presence of anuran species in the microhabitat; whereas temperature and relative humidity did not, suggesting that temperature and relative humidity may be less important for frog distributions along pasture-forest gradients in cloud forest landscapes. The anthropogenic disturbance in the landscape, rather than the edge effects, affects the presence of two rare species (Pristimantis ptochus and Pristimantis kelephas) suggesting that these species display a high degree of sensitivity to the transformation of the cloud forest. Future cloud forest management research needs to incorporate anthropogenic disturbance effects, because it strongly interacts with edge and matrix effects, affecting the habitat quality and the persistence of species in the landscape.},

	abstract = {The estimation of the road edge effect is useful to understand changes induced by the road network on ecosystems. Road networks on islands may break ecosystem integrity through microclimate edge effects, which are known to be associated with disturbances to animal and plant communities. Road edge effects have been scarcely studied on oceanic islands. In this paper we studied road edge effects on microclimate and canopy structure in laurel and pine forests in Tenerife (Canary Islands). We assessed depth of road edge effect for temperature at four vertical layers (soil, litter and air at 5 cm and 1.3 m above ground), light intensity, canopy cover and height, in transects running from narrow (6–7 m width) asphalt roads and dust trails to 100 m to the interior of both forests. We used an ANOVA procedure with Helmert difference contrasts to identify the distances along transects over which edge effects were signiﬁcant. We detected signiﬁcant gradients for most parameters but they were consistently narrow both within and between forests. In the laurel forest, we detected highly signiﬁcant gradients for soil temperature, light, and canopy cover and height in both asphalt and unpaved roads. In the pine forest, we detected a highly signiﬁcant gradient for soil temperature at asphalt roads, and a signiﬁcant light gradient for both asphalt and unpaved roads. From the road edge to the forest interior, signiﬁcant temperature changes persisted for only 3 m, light variation persisted for 6 m, and canopy cover and height changed signiﬁcantly within the ﬁrst 10 m. Asphalt roads and dust trails revealed different patterns of variation for temperature between edge and interior. No differences were found between the two types of roads in edge-interior trends for light or canopy structure. The abruptness of microclimate and canopy gradients was slightly higher in the laurel forest than in the pine forest, caused by a higher edge contrast in the former. The depth of the road edge effect found in laurel and pine forests was small, but it could have cumulative effects on forest microclimate and forest associated biota at the island scale. Such changes deserve attention by local road managers for planning and design purposes.},

	abstract = {Edge structure is one of the principal determinants of the extent and magnitude of edge effects in forest fragments. In central Amazonia, natural succession at forest edges typically produces a dense wall of vegetation dominated by Cecropia spp. that buffers the forest interior. Fire encroachment into forest edges, however, eliminates the soil seed bank, enhances plant mortality, and promotes succession to an open, Vismia-dominated edge that does not buffer the forest interior. Contrasting open, fire-encroached forest edges and closed, non-fire-encroached edges were examined in central Amazonia to assess the effects of edge structure on microclimate and vegetation structure in tropical forest fragments. Edge penetration distances for most microclimate and vegetation structure variables were as much as two to five times greater at open edges than at closed edges. The magnitude of these differences suggests that edge structure is one of the main determinants of microclimate and vegetation structure within tropical forest fragments.},

We measured light exposure, wind speed, air and soil temperature, and vapour pressure deficit (VPD) perpendicular to a north-south aligned, mature, edge of native broadleaf rainforest adjoining grazed pasture. At a point 80 m into the forest from the edge, light was only c. 0.7\% and wind speed c. 20\% of that in the open, and there was much less diurnal fluctuation in soil temperature, air temperature and VPD. The gradient of microclimate near the edge, as measured with a third (mobile) weather station, was abrupt for soil temperature and similar to the pattern of light exposure, with almost complete change over about 10 m. The gradient was less steep for wind speed, air temperature and VPD, with at least 40 m being required to stabilise these variables when wind was directed into the forest. These findings suggest that forest buffers of at least 40 m may be needed to protect forest reserves and streams from climatic exposure.},

From information available in the 'Dutch Forest Statistics', it became clear that at least 50\% of the total forested area in the Netherlands is influenced by edge effects.

	abstract = {Forest edges are known to consist of microenvironments that may provide habitat for a different suite of species than forest interiors. Several abiotic attributes of the microenvironment may contribute to this change across the edge to center gradient (e.g., light, air temperature, soil moisture, humidity). Biotic components, such as seed dispersal, may also give rise to changes in species composition from forest edge to interior. We predicted that abiotic and biotic measures would correlate with distance from forest edge and would differ among aspects. To test these predictions, we measured abiotic and biotic variables on twelve 175 m transects in each of two 24 ha forest fragments in east-central Illinois that have remained in continuous isolation for upwards of 100 years. Both univariate and multivariate techniques were used to best describe the complex relationships among abiotic factors and between abiotic and biotic factors. Results indicate that microclimatic variables differ in the degree to and distance over which they show an edge effect. Relative humidity shows the widest edge, while light and soil moisture have the steepest gradients. Aspect influences are evidenced by the existence of more pronounced edge effects on south and west edges, except when these edges are protected by adjacent habitat. Edges bordered by agricultural fields have more extreme changes in microclimate than those bordered by trees. According to PC A results, species richness correlates well with microclimatic variation, especially light and soil moisture; however, in many cases species richness had a different depth of edge influence than either of these variables. The herbaceous plant community is heavily dominated by three species. Distributions of individual species as well as changes in plant community composition, estimated with a similarity index, indicate that competition may be influencing the response of the vegetation to the edge to interior gradient. This study indicates that edge effects must be considered when the size and potential buffering habitat of forest preserves are planned.},

	abstract = {Aggregated retention is now a common method of regeneration harvest in forest ecosystems managed for both timber and ecological objectives. If residual forest aggregates are to serve as temporary refugia for species sensitive to disturbance or environmental stress, microclimatic conditions must be sufﬁciently buffered to allow for their persistence. In 1-ha aggregates at three experimental sites in western Washington, we quantiﬁed spatial gradients in microclimate (light, air and soil temperature, and soil moisture), effects of aspect on these gradients, and how microclimate compared to conditions in adjacent harvest areas and larger tracts of undisturbed forest (controls). Light availability and temperature were greatest at the edge, but declined sharply inside the aggregate, with most change occurring within 20 m of the edge. Beyond this distance, light generally declined to levels observed in the controls. Soil temperatures exhibited greater spatial variation and stabilized further from the edge (10–30 m), but air temperatures were generally higher than those in controls. Soil moisture exhibited no spatial trends and was comparable among aggregates, harvest areas, and controls. Aspect exerted strong effects on light and temperature, particularly within 15 m of the edge, as did forest structure. Where tree density was low, microclimatic gradients were less steep and aspect-related differences were small. Comparisons with previous studies of ground vegetation indicate that microclimatic effects were consistent, in part, with declines among some groups of vascular and non-vascular plants; however, these declines were restricted to edge environments (5–10 m) and were unaffected by aspect. Our results suggest that 1-ha aggregates are sufﬁciently large to contain areas with light, temperature, and soil moisture that are comparable to those in undisturbed forest and suitable, in the short-term, for persistence of forest-dependent species.},

Woodlots were selected to cover a wide variety of shapes and sizes in each area. Several microclimatic variables, which included temperature at three different heights above the forest ﬂoor, relative humidity, and the amount of light penetration were measured in ﬁve m diameter circular sample plots along transects that covered the length and the width of each fragment. The number of microhabitats that included living trees with creviced and smooth bark, standing dead, different decay classes of downed woody debris, soil and rock were tabulated at each sample plot. Bryophyte and lichen presence was noted for all microhabitats found within each plot. There was a trend of decreasing temperature and light intensity and increasing humidity up to 15 m from the edge of the fragments. A multiple regression analysis revealed that the distance from edge and the habitat heterogeneity were the most important variables affecting bryophyte and lichen species richness. Further analysis indicated that edge effects were signiﬁcant for bryophytes, but not for lichens. The size and shape of fragments had a signiﬁcant effect on habitat heterogeneity, and bryophyte and lichen diversity. Although there was a distinction between the ﬂoras in each region, the effects of fragment size and habitat heterogeneity were similar. An indicator species analysis selected several indicators of large, medium, and small fragments that were also indicators of habitat heterogeneity and species richness. The presence or absence of several indicator species is used to produce performance benchmarks for habitat heterogeneity and species richness. The use of indicator species offers an inexpensive and relatively easy method to evaluate edge effects and habitat heterogeneity on bryophyte and lichen diversity in woodlots.},

The analysis focused on the seasonal variability of microclimate at the forest-savanna ecotone that has so far rarely been investigated. The study was located in an intact mosaic of semi-deciduous forests and savanna in the Comoe´ National Park (northeastern Ivory Coast). The microclimatic parameters air temperature, air humidity, and vapor pressure deﬁcit were measured from the dry season (February) until the rainy season (September) during ﬁve measurement periods (MP). Borders and ecotones including their conﬁdence intervals were determined by a border-and-ecotone detection analysis, which is based on non-linear regression analysis. The ecotone limits were interpreted as DEI towards the two habitats. During the dry season, the microclimatic border between forest and savanna was located further towards the forest interior than during the rainy season. This may be caused by different foliation patterns of tree species at the forest interior and the forest boundary, with the latter being completely defoliated during the dry season. In addition, the variability of microclimatic parameters was higher and differences between forest and savanna were less pronounced during the dry season. The minimum DEI towards the forest interior was 27.4715.5 m for air humidity in the rainy season (MP-5). The maximum DEI of 137.3 7138.3 m occurred for air temperature in the dry season (MP-1). The average DEI for all microclimate parameters and MPs was 50.5 m. These DEI values are similar to observations from temperate and tropical forest boundaries in the literature. As microclimate borders proved to shift over the seasons, detailed knowledge of species’ responses to this variability appears to be essential for predicting concomitant dynamics of forest core areas.},

We measured and analysed trends in microclimatic conditions (air temperature, relative humidity and vapour pressure deﬁcit) over 7 months along three transects extending from core savanna areas to core forest areas.We tested two hypotheses: (i) that the forest edge is subject to microclimatic edge effects, and (ii) that the depth of these edge effects increases during dry periods. Sharp changes in each microclimatic variable were consistently observed between savanna and forest throughout the study period. Microclimatic transitions took place within 5 m outside the forest boundary. Drought levels increased homogenously throughout the forest and were not disproportionately severe in the vicinity of the forest edge. We suggest that these results were related to the fact that the studied period was abnormally humid due to a La Niña episode, and that under such conditions the vulnerability of the forest edge to savanna ﬁres is relatively low. Relatively wet conditions in the savanna close to the forest edge may promote forest expansion by limiting ﬁre spread. Prescribed ﬁres during humid years could reduce fuel loads in savanna without affecting the forest edge, which would prevent ﬁres during the dry years associated with El Niño episodes from having severe impacts.},

Environmental and demographic aspects of plant populations in forest fragments are of great importance for their management and conservation. We conducted a study on the spatial distribution and age structure of five palm species in a forest fragment at the municipality of Três Cachoeiras, in the north coast of Rio Grande do Sul. We delimited 25 10×10 m plots and counted the number of individuals in the stages of seedling, juvenile and adult for each palm species. Aggregation Indices were calculated with software SADIEShell. We performed variation partitioning analyses among species distribution and environmental variables canopy openness and soil moisture. A total of 1,443 plants were counted and the most abundant species was Euterpe edulis. The average density was of 57.72 ind. 100 m-2. Three species showed a pattern of “inverse J”, which indicated that they have a potential for regenerating in that palm community. The predominant spatial pattern was aggregated (Ia{\textgreater}1) and canopy openness did not influence species abundances. Only the distribution of Bactris setosa and Geonoma gamiova, both understory species, was explained by soil moisture, suggesting that other abiotic or biotic factors may be influencing the spatial arrangement of the canopy species.},

	abstract = {A study was conducted in a high altitude tropical forest (shola forest) in peninsular India to examine the changes in floristic composition (mainly woody species regeneration) along an edge to interior gradient in relation to changes in edaphic and microenvironmental factors. Species inventory was taken in 25 m* plots, established at 10 m intervals along edge to interior transects. The measured soil variables included pH, organic carbon, total nitrogen, available phosphorus, and soil moisture. Microenvironmental factors including light transmittance, relative humidity, and air and soil temperatures also were monitored. Both edaphic and microenvironmental factors exhibited strong patterns along the edge to interior gradient. Forest edges were characterized by higher light transmittance, higher air and soil temperatures, and lower relative humidity. Soil variables including pH, organic carbon, total nitrogen, available phosphorus, and moisture increased toward the forest interior. Significant increases in organic carbon (53.9\%), total nitrogen (47\%). and soil moisture (55\%) indicated a relatively fertile forest interior compared with the forest edge. A definite floristic compositional pattern also was observed along the edge to interior gradient which was correlated to the edaphic and microenvironmental variables as revealed by canonical correspondence analysis. It appears that edge effects in these high altitude forests penetrate to a distance of 15-30 m. Further, edaphic factors have an important influence on woody species regeneration, perhaps much more than microenvironmental factors. This indicates that any disturbance that significantly exposes the forest floor, thus lowering soil moisture and altering soil nutrient status, can adversely affect the regeneration of many of the shola species.},

	abstract = {We investigated forest edge effects on the composition, abundance and species richness of epiphyllous (leaf-inhabiting) bryophytes in tropical cloud-forest fragments in the Taita Hills (Eastern Arc Mountains, Kenya). Six sample plots each of 0.04 ha (20 × 20 m) were established along a disturbance gradient extending in 200 m from the forest edge at three sites. Four leaves were collected from each phorophyte species and the diversity of epiphyllous bryophytes examined. Relative humidity and temperature readings were recorded using time-calibrated data loggers and a digital hygrometer. The epiphyllous species composition among localities and forest-edge distance classes were analysed using multivariate procedures. Overall, 1387 leaves distributed across 489 phorophytes were studied, and 95 species of bryophyte epiphylls were found in the 18 0.04-ha plots selected. The richness and distribution of epiphyllous bryophyte species did not change with the forest-edge distance, but rather depended on phorophyte species composition and (micro-) environmental variables such as sunlight exposure and spatial and dimensional canopy structure. The differences in epiphyll diversity among forest fragments were thus influenced by site-specific characteristics. Our findings suggest that management policies addressed to preserve ancient uncut stands that exhibit as much original phorophyte diversity as possible, need to be urgently achieved to protect epiphyll communities in African tropical cloud forests.},

	abstract = {Background: Although impacts of edge effects on forest ecosystems are well known, their consequences on savannas have rarely been explored. Aims: To investigate the inﬂuence of edge effects on the plant community and microclimate of a cerrado fragment in southeastern Brazil.
Methods: Several plant community variables (density, basal area, richness and cover by each vegetation layer) and microclimatic variables (light, air temperature and humidity), were measured in 10 transects across a savanna fragment surrounded by exotic grasses, and were used to ﬁt semi-parametric models relating these variables with the distance from the habitat edge.
Results: Differences in microclimate and tree communities were poorly related to distance from the edge. On the other hand, there were detectable edge effects on the ground layer community (i.e. plants less than 50 cm in height). Edges had a negative effect on native plants of this layer (density and richness of all species and cover of native grasses), while favouring invasive grasses.
Conclusions: Unlike reports for edge effects in forest ecosystems, microclimate does not explain changes in this cerrado fragment. The most signiﬁcant edge effect threatening the conservation of cerrado vegetation is the widespread invasion by African grasses. Starting from the fragment borders, this invasion causes changes in the structure and composition of the native plant community, thus jeopardising the population dynamics and persistence of native species.},

	abstract = {Air temperature, vapor pressure deﬁcit, and light intensity microclimatic gradients were examined along four forest edge and four paired forest interior transects in the East and West Usambara Mountains, Tanzania. Between 14 August 1995 and 11 August 1998, 287, 282, and 196 air temperature, vapor pressure deﬁcit, and light intensity gradients, respectively, were measured along the four forest edge and four interior transects. The relationship between microclimate and distance from the forest edge was examined using piecewise linear regression. All microclimatic gradients were classiﬁed into one of nine shapes based on the sign and the size of the two estimated slopes. The relative frequency in the shapes of 65 percent of air temperature gradients, 52 percent of vapor pressure deﬁcit gradients, and 62 percent of light intensity gradients along forest edge transects exceeded the relative frequency of these same shapes along forest interior transects, indicating that a majority of the forest edge microclimatic gradients measured were inﬂuenced by edge effects. Yet this result also indicated that approximately one-third of all air temperature and light intensity gradients and nearly one-half of all vapor pressure deﬁcit gradients recorded during this study were affected by factors independent of edge effects per se, and that forest edge microclimatic gradients were temporally nonconstant. For air temperature and vapor pressure deﬁcit gradients, low spatial but high temporal variation existed in estimated edge width and the relative change in microclimate between the forest edge and interior. For light intensity gradients, both high spatial and temporal variability characterized estimated edge width and relative change in microclimate between the forest edge and interior. The pooled mean edge width and relative change in microclimate between the forest edge and interior across the four forest edge transects for air temperature, vapor pressure deﬁcit, and light intensity gradients were 94.1 m and 2.00ЊC, 82.6 m and 0.29 kPa, and 60.5 m and 10.6 joules/sec/m2, respectively. These results suggest that forest edge microclimatic gradients in general may be inherently dynamic and nonconstant.},

	abstract = {We investigated diurnal variation in edge gradients of air temperature, vapour pressure deﬁcit (VPD) and wind speed in tropical rainforest in northeastern Australia, adjacent to three types of linear canopy openings: a powerline, a highway and a perennial stream. Edge gradients were compared between the wet and dry seasons. Diurnal ranges of air temperature and VPD were elevated near powerline, highway and stream edges and were greater in the dry season than the wet season although this seasonal difference in temperature ranges was less pronounced near powerline than highway or stream edges. Maximum wind speeds were elevated near all three forest edge types, this increase being most pronounced at stream edges. In contrast, although daytime temperature and VPD were also elevated near all three forest edges, stronger effects were experienced at powerlines and highways compared with streams. Wind speed was greater near forest edges than in the forest interior during the daytime, but this effect varied between seasons and among edge types. Edge gradients in wind speed were present near powerline edges in both wet and dry seasons, but only occurred near highway edges during the dry season and near stream edges during the wet season. Nocturnal microclimatic edge gradients were seldom detected. They were observed only for air temperature near powerlines during the dry season, air temperature being reduced at the forest edge compared with the forest interior. These data indicate that linear clearings for roads and powerlines are associated with microclimatic edge gradients qualitatively similar to those observed in other studies at forest edges adjacent to larger clearings. Such gradients have the potential to substantially increase the edge exposure of forest areas internally fragmented by clearings for human infrastructure.},

Two foliose, green algal lichens were transplanted to the lower canopy of a mature Picea abies forest at six distances (2, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50 and 100 m) from a clearcut. The biomass growth in Platismatia glauca (6.2\% in 16 months) was 41 \% higher than in Lobaria pulmonaria (4.4\%). We found no growth reduction near the forest edge. In contrast, the highest growth in both species occurred within 12 m from the edge. Further, fluorescence and chlorophyll measurements showed that lichen vitality was unaffected by distance from edge. The light intensity was 4.3 times higher at the edge than in the interior during the growing season, but there were only minor differences in air temperature and relative humidity. Monitoring of thallus water content revealed clear differences in both number and length of wetting and drying cycles. However, the total time with water content sufficient for photosynthetic activity was only slightly higher at the edge. The data thus indicate that our gradient in microclimate was too small to significantly affect lichen growth, and that lichens are largely metabolically inactive when large edge-interior contrasts in microclimate occur. Lichen response to forest edge microclimate results from intricate interactions among several biotic and abiotic factors. Linking data on lichen growth, microclimate and thallus water content with physiological measurements provides a framework for future studies of the mechanisms behind abiotic edge effects.},

Sets of seedlings were planted in transects parallel to the border. The experiments were conducted in the warm-dry (April-May) and warm-wet (July-August) seasons. Herbivory damage was measured at the beginning and at the end of each season. Weekly, microclimatic variables were measured in the same positions in which seedlings were planted. During the wet season, herbivory was similar at different distances from the border (ca. 2\%), but during the dry season, herbivory was higher at the forest border (2.75-11.75\%) than at the old-field (0.50-0.75\%). Herbivory and air temperature were higher, and air humidity and soil water content were lower in the abrupt than in the soft edge.

Light influx rather than atmospheric humidity and temperature was the main driving factor affecting lichen diversity along the forest edge-interior gradient, while humidity is the prevailing factor inside the forest.

Among the parameters analyzed, comparing the areas, it was observed that: soil compaction was higher in the secondary forest (0.57 MPa) than in the eucalyptus reforestation (0.43 MPa); the presence of herbaceous plants on the soil occurred less in the eucalyptus reforestation (17.96\%) than in the secondary forest (59.4\%); the canopy cover index was of 45.99\% for the eucalyptus reforestation, while in the secondary forest it was of 61.02\%, being therefore higher for the latter. Nevertheless, according to Kolmogorov Smirnov test, the forest structure is not different between the areas, since the DBH and height values were not different between what was calculated and what was observed.},

The results showed a strong influence of edge effects on all parameters analyzed, that is, vegetation structure, V. aurea aggregation index and microclimate parameters were all different between interior and edge habitats. These results corroborate other studies conducted in different ecosystems, indicating that habitat fragmentation modifies vegetation structure and composition, plant population dynamics and spatial structure, and as a result, local biological diversity is reduced.},

	abstract = {Edge effects are thought to play a key role in fragmented habitats. It is often assumed that edge-avoiding species are more prone to local extinction than non-edge-avoiding species, but there are few data to support this assumption. Also, few data are available on the effects of edges on some groups, and there is little understanding of seasonal changes in edge effect intensity. To better understand the role that edge effects play in fragmented tropical forests, we assessed the distribution of reptiles and amphibians in six littoral rainforest fragments in southeastern Madagascar in 1999 (dry season) and 2000 (wet season). Using randomization tests, we found all three types of edge responses: edge-avoiders, interior-avoiders, and omnipresent species. However, edge responses varied considerably among seasons. For example, some species (e.g., Mantidactylus bicalcaratus, Phelsuma quadriocellata) were strong edge-avoiders in the dry season, but showed no preference for edge or interior habitats during the wet season. Also, edge-avoiding species tended to be more extinction-prone than non-edge-avoiding species. Abiotic data documented signiﬁcantly higher temperatures and dew point temperatures near edges. Wind speed also tended to be higher and relative humidity tended to be lower near edges. Our results indicate that many amphibians and reptiles respond to altered microclimates near edges and these responses have a strong seasonal component. For many species, edge sensitivity does seem to be correlated with extinction vulnerability and therefore should be of primary consideration in plans to conserve biodiversity in fragmented tropical forests.},

	abstract = {Methods: Plant cover, species richness and community structure were compared in circular micro-plots placed under the canopy of B. prunifolia shrubs and in open areas (12 micro-plots in each case) both near and far from the forest border within two 10–12 yr successional plots at 3400 m a.s.l. (a total of 96 micro-plots). Additionally, topsoil temperature was monitored for 1 mo in the four situations under study.
Results: Average and maximum temperature and temperature amplitudes were lower under the canopy of B. prunifolia shrubs than in open areas; this effect being more marked far from the forest edge. Species richness, vegetation cover and the density of dominant forest trees were higher under the shrubs’ canopy than in the inter-shrub spaces. The proximity to the edge of the surrounding forest also had a positive effect on species richness, with no signiﬁcant interaction with the local sampling situation (under shrub vs outside).
Conclusions: Our results suggest that both facilitation and edge effects inﬂuence the effectiveness of vegetation regeneration within old-ﬁelds in the high tropical Andes. Consequently, these processes should be considered for interpreting vegetation dynamics in environmental change scenarios at the tropical mountain tree line and for the design of ecological restoration strategies in these high-diversity ecotones, which have been subjected to large-scale anthropogenic transformations in recent decades.},

	abstract = {Forest edge structure plays a key role in modulating microclimatic edge responses. However, empirical evidence for this is derived almost entirely from ground-based measurements, rather than measurements across the vertical canopy profile. Intuitively, canopy organisms are not only exposed to altered lateral-edge processes but also vertical influences from the hot, dry canopy edge above. The question then is “what is the influence of edge formation on vertical stratification of edge microclimate?” Here, we undertake a novel test of edge influence on vertical stratification of microclimate across the full vertical profile from ground level to upper canopy in a New Zealand temperate rain forest. We hypothesized that there would be a breakdown of vertical stratification at the edge and “compression” of the abiotic envelope experienced by organisms. We deployed 25 data loggers at five heights from canopy down to ground level (0, −2, −4, −8, −16 m) at each of five distances from edge (0, −2, −4, −8, −16 m) and quantified incident light, air temperature, and vapor pressure deficit relative to an external control. As predicted, we found strong evidence of a breakdown of vertical stratification at the edge for all microclimate variables. In generalized linear mixed models there was a significant interaction between vertical height and distance from edge, with microclimate differentials increasing in magnitude from edge to interior at ground level but decreasing in magnitude from edge to interior at canopy level. Attenuation of edge effects was lower above ground level, suggesting that past evidence of microclimatic edge effects based on ground-level measurements may underestimate the full extent of edge influence on vertical stratification of microclimate in forest remnants.},

              Premise:
              After deforestation, environmental changes in the remaining forest fragments are often most intense near the forest edge, but few studies have evaluated plant growth or plasticity of plant growth in response to edge effects.
            
            
              •
              Methods:
              In a 2‐year common garden experiment, we compared biomass allocation and growth of
              Heliconia acuminata
              with identical genotypes grown in 50 × 35 m common gardens on a 25‐year‐old edge and in a forest interior site.
            
            
              •
              Key results:
              Genetically identical plants transplanted to the forest edge and understory exhibited different patterns of growth and biomass allocation. However, individuals with identical genotypes in the same garden often had very different responses. Plants on forest edges also had higher growth rates and increased biomass at the end of the experiment, almost certainly due to the increased light on the forest edge.
            
            
              •
              Conclusions:
              With over 70000 km of forest edge created annually in the Brazilian Amazon, phenotypic plasticity may play an important role in mediating plant responses to these novel environmental conditions.},

To determine how edge zone width varies among stands, microenvironmental gradients were described at ten edge sites in southeastern Pennsylvania and northern Delaware, USA. Sites were selected to allow comparisons of edge orientation and successional development. Significant edge effects were detected in light, temperature, litter moisture, vapor pressure deficit, humidity, and shrub cover, in some cases affecting the forest microenvironment up to 50 m from the edge. Variables which were dependent on direct beam radiation (vapor pressure deficit, temperature, and litter moisture) showed strong edge-oriented gradients at edges facing east, west, and south, but none at north-facing sites. Exclusion of light by closure of the side canopy curtailed edge effects in these variables. By contrast, edge-oriented gradients of shrub cover and humidity occurred independently of edge aspect and beyond the limits of direct beam radiation. Edge zone microenvironment remained distinguishable from that of continuous forest even after closure of the side canopy.},

However, habitat fragmentation and edge effects exposes vegetation to outside microclimatic conditions, thereby reducing the ability of the forest to buffer climatic variation. In this paper, we ask what proportion of forest in a fragmented ecosystem is impacted by altered microclimate conditions driven by edge effects, and extrapolate these results to the whole Atlantic Forest biome, one of the most disturbed biodiversity hotspots. To address these questions, we collected above and below ground temperature for a full year using temperature sensors placed in forest fragments of different sizes, and at different distances from the forest edge.},

We studied edge effects on microclimate and tree transpiration rates during wet and dry seasons along a 250 m transect spanning the edge of an unpaved road into an old growth tropical lowland forest in the Central Brazilian Amazon. Canopy openness decreased only minimal from the road (3.68\%) towards the forest interior (1.69\%). Vapor pressure deﬁcit (measured at 2.2 m height above ground) was lower in the forest interior. The edge effect on microclimate penetrated deeper into the forest ({\textgreater}100 m) during the dry season compared to the wet season ({\textless}100 m). Overall, sap ﬂux, and therefore transpiration rate, was 54\% higher in trees adjacent to the road compared to forest interior trees. Higher transpiration rates at the forest edge can be explained by higher turbulences and energy exchange of the canopy boundary layer and by a shift in species composition to high water using secondary forest species 25 years after the road construction. Similar changes might be expected for other disturbances affecting local relative humidity and in situations that favor plants with water use traits differing from those found in the forest interior. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

A total of 346 individuals, composing of nine species and nine genera, were identiﬁed. The diversity of orchids in the studied area is low, and the abundance of species in the fragment is not distributed evenly. The edge has more species and individuals, showing it to be more beneﬁcial for the survival of orchids, especially when associated to the watercourse. This increase in the orchid population in the edge can be related to luminosity.

In this study we assessed a set of 10 aged ({\textgreater} 80 years) fragments (3.0 – 3,500 ha in size) of the Atlantic forest to examine to what extent fragment microclimatic attributes are correlated with distance to the nearest edge as frequently proposed in the literature. We used 129 sampling points and took a total of 516 measures of air temperature and humidity, vapor pressure deficit and light incidence to characterize the microclimate of forest fragments in terms of their relative deviation from the surrounding matrix. Fragments as a whole presented strong internal variation and strongly differed from the microclimate exhibited by the open matrix of sugar-cane fields. Distance to nearest edge, percentage of forest cover around the measurement point, percentage of edge-affected area, and geographical orientation of the nearest edge all proved to have minor effects on the microclimate of forest fragments. Conversely, we identified percentage of forest cover and fragment area as the most significant explanatory variables driving their microclimatic configuration: as forest cover increases at landscape scale, forest microclimate deviates less from the open matrix (a forest-mediated matrix buffering). Our results suggest that microclimatic conditions are spatially complex, as they do not correlate with the distance to the nearest forest edges; rather, they are driven by a forest-mediated buffering of the surrounding matrix that minimizes heat and humidity exchanges between forest and non-forest habitats, thus shaping the microclimatic signature of isolated forest fragments.},
